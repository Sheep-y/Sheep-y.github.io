<blockquote class="pub"> There is serenity in balance, and no one knows this better than the Balance Sage. Able to assail multiple targets at once while at the same time absorbing their vitality, the Balance Sage is a formidable presence in long-range engagements. </blockquote>
<blockquote class="imp"> Delving ever deeper into the dark side of the Force can lead to madness, but it can also lead to immense power. Attacking multiple enemies simultaneously and instilling terror in their hearts, all while sapping their very life essence from afar, the Madness Sorcerer is a dark threat unlike any other. </blockquote>

<h2 id="intro"> Balance Sage: Overview </h2>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Lighted robed, lightsaber wielding, seeks wisdom and allies over action. </li>
   <li class="pub"> Story highlights: Recover artifacts, visit kotor characters, form alliances and armies as a Jedi Master, join the Jedi Council, make a holocron. </li>
   <li class="imp"> Story highlights: Learn dark rituals, gather Sith ghosts, war a Darth and take his Dark Council seat. </li>
   <li> Spec: Ranged DoT, Jedi (Force-user), off-heal. </li>
   <li> Pros: Mobility, AoE, self heal, team support. </li>
   <li> Cons: Few defences, lack of burst. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="Quick Tips">
   <li> Stay in middle of group.  Don't go first.  Stay back and close to cover once combat starts. </li>
   <li> Trash fights: start with Sever Force and/or Weaken Mind on a foe that don't die fast, then spread them with Force in Balance. </li>
   <li> Keep Weaken Mind on.  Use Force in Balance and Force Serenity on cooldown.  Vanquish should be used on cooldown too, and needs to be primed by spamming Telekinetic Throw. </li>
   <li> Maintain self bubble, spend Force Mend when need heal. Force Speed and flee when hp drops fast. Binds Force Barrier to a easy key for desperate time. </li>
   <li> Use bubble to "off-heal" in live combat, but keep it minimal.  We should cleanse ourself.  Use in-combat revive if necessary. </li>
   <li> Suggested utilities: Pain Bearer, Tectonic Master, Telekinetic Defense, Valiance, Egress, Mental Defense, Metaphysical Alacrity, Valorous Spirit. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Excels at kiting and long fights, arguably the hardest Sage discipline. </li>
   <li> Stable rotation, zero proc dependency, very reliable relic proc. </li>
   <li> Self-heals give great stamina in long fights, often the last one standing in a full wipe, but few ways to survive burst damage. </li>
   <li> Telekinetic is Sage's burst DPS spec, highly proc based, very fast action in burst window. Perfect for leveling. </li>
   <li> Seer is Sage's heal spec, very versatile and efficient, the most mobile heal spec. </li>

<ul class="note">
   <li> We can move around during steps 1 to 4 (or 1 to 5 with utilities); find a safe place to throw skittles. </li>

   <li> Next rotation. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Everything after first Telekinetic Throw are fillers, but it's best to do one more Telekinetic Throw to maintain the buffs. </li>
   <li> Off-GCD ability is best queued after instant ability, before GCD finishes, together with next ability for lowest delay. </li>
   <li> Mental Alacrity must be before Vanquish for maximum throughput. </li>
   <li> Use Force Empowerment after Mental Alacrity for boss or burn phase. </li>

<ul class="note">
   <li> Use experience to judge whether to put one DoT or two, and which. </li>

<h3 id="attacks"> Main Attacks </h3>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Dealing damage is our main job. </li>
   <li> Basic Attack: Telekinetic Throw (regen Force). </li>
   <li> Use on cooldown: Vanquish, Force in Balance, Force Serenity. </li>
   <li> Never hardcast Vanquish except to start a fight. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-1"> Telekinetic Throw </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 2: Deals 9k kinetic damage and regain 12 Force over 2.1 sec. channel. During channel it immobilizes weak and standard target, otherwise slows target's movement speed by 50% instead. </li>
   <li> 2.1 sec. channel (four ticks), 15 sec. cooldown, range 30m, 27 Force. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Zero-cooldown basic attack, good damage and give us force, but can't use on move. </li>
   <li> 4 hits (a full channel) make next Vanquish and Disturbance instant cast and do higher damage at less force (last 15s). </li>
   <li> Each hits also buff DoT crit chance by 2% (max 8%, last 10s). </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Whenever we can stay still and big powers are on CD; priming Vanquish is very important. </li>
   <li> Finish off near death trash mobs and adds. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Ticks immediately and then twice per second, 4 ticks total. </li>
   <li> Hits does not need to be continuous for the buffs; can run, hit twice, run, hit twice. </li>
   <li> At level 40, each tick has 20% chance to trigger Rippling Force which immediately deals around half tick damage and can crit. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-29"> Vanquish (Mind Crush) </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 58: Casts and deals 5k kinetic damage, plus 15k kinetic damage over 9 sec. and redistribute 10% of the damage to heal you. The target is Vulnerable for 45 seconds, taking 5% more damage from Force attacks. Replaces Mind Crush. </li>
   <li> Level 14 Mind Crush: Casts and deals XXX kinetic damage, plus XXX kinetic damage over 9 sec. and redistribute 10% of the damage to heal you. </li>
   <li> 2s casted, 15s cooldown, range 30m, 27 Force. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Our biggest attack, good upfront (burst) damage, heaviest and quickest tick. (tick per 1s) </li>
   <li> Always use after primed by Throw. 25% damage on our biggest attack. </li>
   <li> Make target vulnerable 5% to Force damage. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Hardcast to start a combat. This is an exception to no hardcast rule. </li>
   <li> Use on cooldown.  Telekinetic Throw often and save the buff to be used on cooldown. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Ticks once per seconds for 9 seconds, 9 ticks total after upfront damage. </li>
   <li> Upfront damage is not DoT tick and does not enjoy DoT buffs. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-27"> Sever Force </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 26: Immobilizes the target for 2 sec. (once per 9 sec.), plus deals 10k internal damage over 18 sec. and redistribute 10% of the damage to heal you. </li>
   <li> Instant, no cooldown, range 30m, 18 Force. </li>

   <li> Long lasting DoT, spreadable by Force in Balance. </li>
   <li> Pin victim on a hidden cooldown of 9 seconds. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Whenever the target is not going to fall in a few seconds or so. </li>
   <li> DoT spreading by Force in Balance or manually. </li>
   <li> To start a fight on a melee foes when its friends are ranged, so that they stay together for easy DoT spread. </li>
   <li> To prevent kiting opponent from closing or jumping on us. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Ticks immediately and once per 3 seconds for 18 seconds, 7 ticks total. </li>
   <li> Deals internal (yellow) damage, which bypass many defences. </li>
   <li> Cost only half the Force of Weaken Mind, and should be preferred over it. </li>
   <li> Heals us 10% of the damage dealt (lv. 52+), very little even when spread. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-7"> Weaken Mind </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 16: Deals 10k internal damage over 18 sec., and redistribute 10% of the damage to heal you. </li>
   <li> Instant, no cooldown, range 30m, 32 Force. </li>
   <li> Utilities: Confound </li>
</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Long lasting DoT, spreadable by Force in Balance. </li>
   <li> Does not pin target, sometimes good for DoT spread. </li>
   <li> Victim takes great bonus damage from Force Serenity. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Whenever the target is not going to fall in a few seconds or so. </li>
   <li> DoT spreading by Force in Balance or manually. </li>
   <li> To start a fight when all foes are melee, so that they zerg us as a group for easy DoT spread. </li>
   <li> Before Force Serenity, when target would not be near death after Serenity. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Ticks immediately and once per 3 seconds for 18 seconds, 7 ticks total. </li>
   <li> Deals internal (yellow) damage, which bypass many defences. </li>
   <li> Double Force cost of Sever Force but slightly less damage. </li>
   <li> Heals us 10% of the damage dealt (lv. 52+), very little even when spread. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-26"> Force in Balance </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 10: Deals 7k internal damage to up to 8 targets in a 5m radius AoE, and redistribute 20% of the total damage to heal you. </li>
   <li> Instant (0.2 sec delay), 15 sec. cooldown, range 30m, 45 Force. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Biggest and instant AoE. Spread Sever Force and Weaken Mind. </li>
   <li> Put counted debuff on victims that boost DoT damage and refund Force. </li>
   <li> Also put a debuff that increases AoE damage taken. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Spread Sever Force and/or Weaken Mind to every target if <i>any</i> target have them. </li>
   <li> Spread both DoTs if possible, but if the target is flimsy and will die before that, DoT(s) a different target or just fire Force in Balance as burst AoE (without any DoT). </li>
   <li> Use on cooldown. Group, Single, Bursting, Kiting, just cast it on CD. </li>
   <li> Except when a close group of adds are expected soon, in which case reserve this for them. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Newly spread DoTs will have full duration, but existing DoTs won't be refreshed. </li>
   <li> Newly spread DoTs will immediately tick, adding to burst damage. </li>
   <li> Has time delay between activation and effect, around 0.2 seconds, must manually aim and adjust for enemies' movements. </li>
   <li> Consumes multiple Force Potency when used on multiple targets. Not optimal but acceptable. </li>
   <li> Deals internal (yellow) damage, which bypass many defences. </li>
   <li> At level 68, Resonant Pulse has 50% proc on <i>each</i> target, damaging itself and <i>all</i> enemies in its 5 meters. </li>
   <li> The pulse will not hit Lift and other mez, but the main attack will. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-28"> Force Serenity </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 42: Casts and deals 7k internal damage, and redistribute 100% of the damage to heal you. </li>
   <li> 1.5 sec. cast, 12 sec. cooldown, range 30m, 45 Force. </li>
   <li> Utilities: Force Mobility </li>
</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Biggest burst attack, also our main self-heal. </li>
   <li> 30% more damage (and heal) against weakened target. </li>
   <li> Force cost -15 when used after Force in Balance. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Use on cooldown, after weaken mind and Force in Balance. </li>
   <li> Skip Force in Balance if it is on cooldown or on reserve. </li>
   <li> Telekinetic Throw instead if target is too weak to waste Weaken + Serenity. </li>
   <li> Best used of Force Potency because of high damage and heal. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Heal us 100% of damage dealt. (50% before lv. 52) Which generates normal heal threat. </li>
   <li> Deals internal (yellow) damage, which bypass many defences. </li>
   <li> Damage is back-loaded; follow with front-loaded damage (Force in Balance/Project) to create a damage burst. </li>
   <li> Don't need to be used immediately after Force in Balance; the force cost discount depends on its counted DoT debuff, which takes at least 4 GCD to spent. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-2"> Force Quake </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 4: Deals 8k kinetic damage over 3 sec. channel to up to 8 targets in a 8m radius AoE. 33% chance to stuns each standard and weak target every second. </li><!-- TEST STUN DURATION -->
   <li> 3 sec. channel, no cooldown, range 30m, 54 Force. </li><!-- TEST FORCE REDUCTION -->
   <li> Utilities: Tectonic Master </li>
</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Primary weapon of mass destruction against flimsy enemies. </li>
   <li> 33% chance to stun each standard and weak target per tick.  </li>
   <li> Zero cooldown and very big radius.  But slow start, unmovable, and high Force cost. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Stun and dispatch a big groups of flimsy or near-death opponents. </li>
   <li> Always use Force in Balance first: bursty, cheaper, and applies AoE debuff. </li>
   <li> Do not use on non-trivial foes; DoTs and focus fire them. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> 3 seconds channel, ticks once per second. </li>
   <li> Roughly equals to saber striking every target, at a high Force cost. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-0"> Disturbance </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 1: Casts and deals 6k kinetic damage. </li>
   <li> 1.5 sec. cast, no cooldown, range 30m, 36 Force. </li><!-- TEST COOLDOWN -->
</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Situational rotation filler. Primed by Telekinetic Throw like Vanquish. </li>
   <li> Low damage and take time to cast when unprimed, worse than Project. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When Disturbance is primed, and Vanquish is on cooldown longer than 3 seconds, and we can Telekinetic Throw in time to prime and Vanquish, and we have nothing else to do like self Bubble or self Rejuvenate. </li>
   <li> In all other cases, just Telekinetic Throw. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> At level 40, has 60% chance to trigger Rippling Force which immediately deals around ⅕ damage. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="jc-3"> Project </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 1: Deals 6k kinetic damage, and stuns standard and weak target for 3 sec. </li>
   <li> Instant, 6 sec. cooldown, range 30m, 36 Force. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> The initial ranged attack of Jedi Consular, still useful at high level. </li>
   <li> Moderate instant damage, quick cooldown, stuns standard and weak enemy 0.5s. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When we are running and want to attack, and other attacks are on cooldown. </li>
   <li> Quickly stun a standard or weak enemy to interrupt its channel/cast or just give it a pause. </li>
   <li> To spend last Force Potency on, when Force in Balance and Force Serenity are both on cooldown. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Telekinetic Throw is often a better choice, even when kiting, because of Throw's buffs and zero CD. One primed Vanquish is worth 4 Projects. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="jc-2"> Saber Strike </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 1: Deals 4k weapon damage, spread across 3 melee attacks. </li>
   <li> Instant, no cooldown, range 4m, no force cost. </li>
   <li> Utilities: Impeding Slash </li>
</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Our first and only melee attack, we have outgrown it as a DPS. </li>
   <li> For practical purpose, just forget Saber Strike ever exists. </li>
</ul>



<h3 id="controls"> Controls </h3>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Lift furthest foe(s), stun strongest, interrupt all interruptible boss. </li>
   <li> Control (mez, stun, and interrupts) is our responsibility as a DPS. </li>
   <li> Tanks are busy, healers lack accuracy. Control is our duty. </li>
   <li> We lack in interrupts, but have some of the best controls. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="jc-6"> Force Lift </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 7: Prevents target from acting for 60 sec. or until damaged. Non-player, non-standard and non-weak targets heal rapidly while lifted. </li>
   <li> 2 sec. cast, 60 sec. cooldown, range 30m, 9 Force. </li>
   <li> Utilities: Dizzying Force, Containment </li>
</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> The best soft crown control (mez) in game. </li>
   <li> Works on any controllable targets, including droids and turrets. </li>
   <li> Breaks on <i>any</i> damage, including DoT. </li>
   <li> Very powerful when augmented by utilities. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Take tough target(s) out of action while dealing with its more fragile friends. </li>
   <li> Take fresh target(s) (before DoT) out of action for a break (self heal, cooldown etc.) </li>
   <li> Disturb (inc. interrupts) kiting target(s) without pushing it away or Force Wave is on cooldown. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li class="pvp"> Last 8 seconds in PvP. </li>
   <li> Starred NPCs (strong or above) recovers hp when lifted, but totally worth it. </li>
   <li> Kite the other enemies away (5 meter+) to avoid Resonant Pulse hitting the target(s). </li>
   <li> After we lift the furthest foe a few times, smart teammates will learn to expect it and leave them alone. </li>
   <li> All op bosses, most fp bosses, and many ch bosses are immune. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="jc-4"> Force Wave </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 3: Deals 2k kinetic damage and knocks back up to 8 enemies in a 15m frontal cone. Also knocks down (stun) standard and weak enemies for 3 seconds. </li>
   <li> Instant, 20 sec. cooldown, range 15m, 9 Force. </li>
   <li> Utilities: Psychic Suffusion, Force Wake. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> On of the three pushes in game and arguably the best (when used correctly). </li>
   <li> Push all enemies in the 135° cone away from us, usually ahead, but adjacent ones may go backward or sideways. </li>
   <li> Thus, when positioned correctly, Force Wave can push both ways on bridges. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Push enemies down high cliffs and bridges. </li>
   <li> Push widespread enemies close together for easier AoE and DoT spread. </li>
   <li> Disturb multiple enemies, stopping their casts, channels, and movements. </li>
   <li> Do <i>not</i> do the last while in a team; it'd nullify teammates' attacks if the targets are pushed out of range. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Force Wave's push distance is the lowest of all three. </li>
   <li> Cone goes towards character facing, not camera facing. </li>
   <li> Pushing enemies to a wall is a easy way to line them up, but will result in a wide line if standing too close when push. </li>
   <li> On some PvE maps the NPCs won't die from the fall; wait for them to respawn and dispatch normally (don't push again). </li>
   <li> All op bosses, most fp bosses, and many ch bosses are immune. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="jc-5"> Force Stun </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 5: Deals 3k kinetic damage and stuns the target for 4 sec. </li>
   <li> Instant, 60 sec. cooldown, range 10m, 9 Force. </li>
   <li> Utilities: Staggering Stratagem </li>
</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> A hard stun that is not interrupted by damages. </li>
   <li> Use on the toughest enemy in a group, esp. when it casts or channels. </li>
   <li> Generally speaking, stun often and stun early in PvE. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> I usually stun after DoT spread on trash mobs, when I switch to single target focus fire. </li>
   <li> Also serves as an alternative interrupt, just with a long cooldown. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Watch teammate's stun.  Overlapped stuns is a waste. </li>
   <li> In a quick fight we usually don't need to stun. </li>
   <li> Companion in damage role has a ranged stun with lower cooldown. (At least they don't have mez.) </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="jc-10"> Mind Snap </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 18: Interrupts the target's current action and prevents that ability from being used for 4 sec. </li>
   <li> Instant (Off-GCD), 18 sec. fixed cooldown, range 30m, no Force cost. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Our basic interrupt ability, stops the target's current cast or channel. </li>
   <li> Mind Snap is off-GCD: use it when we see a slow cast or channel and immediately resume next attack. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Use on big attacks of any interruptible champions and bosses.  The slower the deadlier. </li>
   <li> Also work great on trash mob healers (medics/repair bots).  </li>
</ol>

   <li> Utilities: Metaphysical Alacrity </li>
</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> There are few times when we want to slow a slowable enemy instead of using more efficient attacks. </li>
   <li> Such as Telekinetic Throw, which also slow (or pin) the target while doing higher damage and buffs us. </li>
   <li> Can be used on the move, unlike Telekinetic Throw. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When we kite a slowable enemy, usually champions. <span class="pvp">And pvp.</span> </li>
   <li> When we are running and other mobile attacks are on cooldown. </li>

<ul class="note">
   <li> Damage is on par with Saber Strike, which is among our lowest. </li>
   <li> Overlaps with Confound to virtually pins the victim. </li>

<h3> Heals and Defenses </h3>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Not our main job, unless there are kolto stations where we can stand by while we attack. </li>
   <li> Run away and hide behind cover (LoS) is a damage control skill that we must get into habit of, as a ranged DoT DPS. </li>
   <li> Force Mend is our main self heal and is free. Force Serenity is our 2<sup>nd</sup> biggest attack <i>and</i> self heal. Use them. </li>
   <li> Life Ward has the potential to give us lots of self heals in boss fights. </li>
   <li> Bubble is our most efficient "heal". Throw it out when a friend needs help. </li>
   <li> After combat, revive fallen mates and heal them.  We can revive in combat, but let healer do that. </li>
   <li> When necessary, don't forget Heroic Moment, Unity/Sacrifice (gets from Light/Dark V), Medpaks, and Shielding adrenal. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Since we are not healer, our heals generate full threat. </li>
   <li> Healing generate threat on every enemy, drawing their fire if no one else has threat, in which case Cloud Mind won't save us. </li>
   <li> Absorption is no longer bugged; multiple absorbs run on a first come first absorb rule. </li>
   <li> We can protect and heal friendly NPC under attacks, potentially trolling Imperials in PvE instance. </li>

</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Keep it on ourselves always, except: </li>
   <li> If a Seer Sage is on the team and likes to bubble us, let him/her do it. Theirs are stronger, have shorter lockout, and heal us on pop. </li>
   <li> If there is no Sage healer or if (s)he isn't bubbling, we can bubble teammate(s) before combat. </li>
   <li> Throw a bubble over when a teammate is taking a beating. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Bubble is not heal, and will not crit or be affected by healing bonus/penalties. </li>
   <li> When placed on teammate, absorbed damage is their threat, not our threat. </li>
   <li> Bubble utilities only apply to own bubble, and will be visually different. </li>

   <li> Our basic heal, low cooldown and cost efficient. </li>

</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When attack can't be made and bubble is not an option, such as kiting. </li>
   <li> Pre-combat defence buff. Note that this will aggro all NPCs when we are hurt, get healed, and thus create threats. </li>
   <li> Keep it (and bubble, and Force Mend) up in a long fight to mitigate damage. </li>
   <li> Post-combat recovery. Use before Meditation. </li>
   <li> To "ping" or "touch" a friend out of combat. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Tick once per 3 seconds, three ticks total after upfront heal. </li>
   <li> May be used on CD. Do 30% more heals on cooldown than end-to-end. </li>
   <li> Upfront heal will consume Force Potency which is very wasteful. The HoT ticks do not. </li>
   <li> Rejuvenate heals very little but gives a lasting off-heal impression because of HoT. </li>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Our "burst" heal, can be spammed but can't move and pretty expensive. </li>

   <li> No pushback mitigation, don't use when under fire. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When there is a <i>very</i> urgent need of us to heal, like when we just need to buy two seconds for a tank. </li>

   <li> When the healer is not cleansing or need a hand (too many to cleanse or too busy healing). </li>
   <li> When we are on our own and need a cleanse, obviously. </li>

</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Don't bother to cleanse if the debuff is minor, like small burns or common armor reduce. </li>

        Which may be us. Don't rob ourselves of our revive chance! </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> In a long combat it is possible to do multiple revival, since the cooldown and debuff are both 5 minutes. </li>
   <li> Alacrity lowers ability cooldown but not debuff time, so the cooldown is effectively fixed, except after a group wipe. </li>
   <li> Our out of combat revive has no cooldown, and we should revive fallen comrades after combat. </li>

</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Spend a GCD to sacrifice force regen for instant force. </li>
   <li> Telekinetic Throw is almost always a better choice. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When and only when we are hiding or running and have no one to attack and nothing else to do. </li>
   <li> One of the worse to spend time, but still better than not doing anything. </li>
   <li> If often run out of force, revise rotation habit; Balance Sage depends on synergies to save Force. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Each use has a net gain of 20 Force, but we are wasting that GCD. </li>
   <li> A full Telekinetic Throw regens 28+ Force (36+ with 4-set bonus), while dealing damage and priming Vanquish/Disturbance. </li>
   <li> Vindicate is the main Force regen ability of Seers. When we respec we need it on the bar and easy to click. </li>

   <li> Useful when soloing hard content, when there is only companion to dump threat to (if allowed/useful). Make it a DCD instead is a good trade. </li>
   <li> In a team we usually need to use Cloud Mind on cooldown (if we are good), which means we can't afford to reserve it for DCD. </li>

</ul>
<ul class="good">
   <li> <b class="good">Good</b>.
        Decent choice for when we don't know what to pick, since it guarantees some passive dps. </li>
   <li> Think an extra Disturbance every time it counter attacks, which is pretty good and almost guarenteed. </li>
   <li> Don't intentionally run into melee range or ignoring threat dump to attract fire just to get this to fire; DoT on a far enemy or AoE should catch enough attentions, don't give tank/healer headaches. </li>
   <li> Excellent for soloing low-power conflict where we are always under attack <i>and</i> bubble can take a few hits. </li>

<ul class="maybe">

   <li> Heroic: Force Speed purges all movement-impairing effects and granting immunity to them for the duration. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="maybe">
   <li> <b class="maybe">Situational</b>.
        Very useful in boss fights that slows or pins us. </li>
   <li> Does not limit debuff type or number, unlike Restoration. </li>
   <li> Can be used with Metaphysical Alacrity for shorter Force Speed CD. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-13"> Mental Defense </h4>

<ul class="vgood">
   <li> <b class="vgood">Recommended</b>.
        Most classes has either reduction as passive. We have neither. </li>
   <li> Boss stuns and AoEs are often deadly. When in doubt, take it. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-14"> Metaphysical Alacrity </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Heroic: Reduces cooldowns of Force Speed by 5 seconds, Force Slow by 3 seconds, and Force Barrier by 30 seconds. Force Speed lasts 0.5 seconds longer. Mental Alacrity increases movement speed by 100% (up from 50%) while active. Force Speed finish cooldown when Force Barrier ends. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="maybe">
   <li> <b class="maybe">Situational/By Preference</b>.
        If you like to Force Speed a lot, you should pick this. </li>
   <li> Directly reduce Egress cooldown, useful in some boss fights. </li>
   <li> Feels good in solo <span class="pvp">and PvP </span>where we can run freely. </li>
   <li> Make Force Barrier CD slightly more reasonable as a bonus. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-15"> Kinetic Collapse </h4>

</ul>
<ul class="good">
   <li> <b class="good">Good/By Preference</b>.
        Give us a free and frequent passive crowd control, up to once every 20s. </li>
   <li> Blind is like stun. Blinded characters stops what they are doing and can't act while blinded. </li>
   <li> Not triggered when refreshing bubble before it pops, but triggered by manual removal of bubble buff (right click it). </li>
   <li> We must stay close to enemies to blind them, which runs counter to our usual stay back style. </li>
   <li class="pvp"> In PvP it can unintentionally fills up opponent's resolve. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-16"> Containment </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Heroic: Force Lift activates instantly. If your Force Lift breaks early from damage, the target is stunned for 2 seconds. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="maybe">
   <li> <b class="maybe">By Preference</b>.
        Essentially gives us two interrupts and/or stuns. </li>
   <li> Also make our Force Lift usable on the go and immune from pushback, which is when we need Force Lift most. </li>
   <li> Useful on adds in boss fights where they are spread wide and far. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-17"> Force Wake </h4>

</ul>
<ul class="bad">
   <li> <b class="bad">Avoid</b>.
        Force Wave is not something we use often even when solo. </li>
   <li> <i>Maybe</i> useful when we want to push and flee, such as just running pass, or group kiting. </li>

<ul class="good">
   <li> <b class="good">Good/By Preference</b>.
        Useful when there are lots of running but not much else happening. </li>
   <li> Some players consider this mandatory. I say the opportunity cost is high for making 10% of our rotation mobile. </li>
   <li> Main problem: does not make Force Serenity immune to pushbacks, interrupts, or support peek and fire. </li>
   <li> Worse case without it is wasting and delaying it by a GCD by aborting the cast. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-19"> Swift Rejuvenation </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Legendary: Restoration activate instantly your next casted ability. Last up to 15 seconds and limited to once per 30 seconds. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="bad">
   <li> <b class="bad">Very situational</b>.
        Pick this to "prime" Force Serenity, Force Lift, or (if necessary) Vanquish before combat or behind cover. </li>
   <li> Wasteful because of extra GCD, even when it can <i>somewhat</i> replace Force Mobility and Containment. </li>
   <li> More useful as part of a team, where we let other go first and do our control and rotations later. </li>
   <li> Once upon a time all casted abilities light up when this triggers, making it easier to use. </li>
   <li> Do not pick just because we may cleanse. Most lower rank utilities are better options. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-20"> Life Ward </h4>

</ul>
<ul class="good">
   <li> <b class="good">Good default</b>.
        Think a Rejuvenate tick every second. </li>
   <li> Enduring Bastion is the 5 second shield left after Force Barrier ends. </li>
   <li> Best for between-combat recovery and downtime rich boss fights, and helps when LoS or kiting. </li>
   <li> Fantastic heal when the boss is the kind that focus on the tank and leave us alone. </li>
   <li> Let Force Barrier heals us up to 28% hp. Bubble right before or right after Force Barrier for even more heal. </li>
   <li> Not so useful for trash and solo fights, but useful between fights in these cases. </li>
   <li> Further reduce our healing efficiency as a side effect. </li>
   <li> Remember, actual heals generate a tiny threat to every NPC! </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-21"> Valorous Spirit </h4>

        More Force Mend and free damage reduction when we need it? Yes please. </li>

</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-22"> Ethereal Entity </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Legendary: Reduce Phase Walk cooldown by 15 seconds. Phase Walk teleportation grants Ethereal Entity, increase defenses by 30% and grant immunity to leaps, pulls, interrupts, and pushbacks for 10 seconds. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="maybe">
   <li> <b class="maybe">Situational</b>.
        Turns Phase Walk into a DCD that we can use on par with Blockout Cloud Mind. </li>
   <li> Helps when kiting melee bosses who jump over as soon as (s)he gets LoS. </li>
   <li> Also useful when using Phase Walk a lot, like retrying jumps, so that we can spend less time on reddits. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-23"> Impeding Slash </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Legendary: Replace Saber Strike. Cooldown 15s. Lash the target with your lightsaber, dealing XXX weapon damage and immobilize it for 3 seconds, then slow it by 50% for 6 seconds. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="bad">
   <li> <b class="warn">Avoid</b>.
        The cooldown is longer than the pin and slow, and we must let the foe get close to use it. </li>
   <li> There are better utilities in<span class="pvp"> both</span> PvE<span class="pvp"> and PvP</span>. </li>

<h2 id="tips"> Leveling and Gearing </h2>

<h3 id="leveling"> Leveling </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Low levels: Use Force Quake and Force in Balance to dispatch minions, then Telekinetic Throw/Project remaining foe(s). Use Lift/Stun to pause tough NPCs. </li>
   <li> Mid levels: With instant Mind Crust at lv 24 and DoT spread at lv 28, we can meaningfully contribute in veteran flashpoints, a good way to learn and level up. </li>
   <li> Level 42+: With Force Serenity, we may use the Very Simple Rotation, but take away the final Telekinetic Throw. </li>
   <li> Level 56+: Telekinetic Throw now ticks fast so can add the droped Throw back into rotation. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Free to play is limited to level 50.  Subscribe once to have access to current level cap forever.  Amazon and Origin sell cheaper packs than official site. </li>
   <li> When a new expansion lands, again just subscribe once to raise to new level cap. </li>
   <li> Many veterans stop playing much class story after getting starship (or even before that); Heroics and Flashpoints levels up quicker. </li>

   <li> PvE stats: 110% accuracy, then Crit &gt; Power &gt; Mastery &gt; Endurance. Leave alacrity until endgame. </li>
   <li> Modifications: Versatile hilt/armoring, Lethal Mod (unlettered), Initiative Enhancements. No augments until end game. </li>
   <li> Upgrade main hand hilt, off hand armoring, chest armoring, and legs armoring at level X. They have biggest impact on attack and defence. </li>
   <li> Upgrade the rest whenever you like. I upgrade every two steps (8 to 10 levels). </li>
   <li> Optionally, run veteran flashpoints to get purple gears at current level, requires subscription or artifact authorisation. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Same relic effects don't stack; don't use two relic that proc the same stat.  I prefer proc relic over clicky relic; we have enough to click already. </li>
   <li> 110% accuracy is required to always hit NPCs, to ensures instant Vanquish from a complete Telekinetic Throw.<span class="pvp"> 105% in pvp for the same.</span> </li>

   <li> Skip defensive stats (defense, shielding, absorption). We don't have the abilities to make good use of them. </li>
   <li> High endurance is not worth the mastery and power we lost. Always pick power and mastery over endurance, but after critical and alacrity. </li><!-- Plot a chart to find 5.7 falloff point -->

<h3 id="gearing_endgame"> Endgame Gearing </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> At level 70, we earn cxp to rank up Galatic Command, split into 4 tiers. </li>
   <li> Each rank gives a command crate. Open crates to get corresponding end game gear with set bonus. Put augmentations on gold gears. </li>
   <li> Power &amp; mastery proc relics (Serendipitous Assault &amp; Focused Retribution) are considered best since critical relic hits diminishing return. </li>
   <li> At full 14x ir248 gear with 228 to 236 augments, we have 3654 to 3682 stat budget for Accuracy, Critical, and Alacrity, plus 214 Critical from Relics and Crystals, plus 339 with accuracy/critical stim. </li>
   <li> 737 Accuracy gives us 110% after companion bonus (see notes). 2x Initiative Enhancement/Package/Device and 3x Accuracy Augment gives us 750 to 756. </li>
   <li> Alacrity should be a bit above 703 or 1860.  1x Quick Savant E/P/D and 5x Alacrity Augment gives us 711 to 721, next best is same with Accuracy. </li>
   <li> 1860 Alacrity yields higher dps on dummy, but not necessary in live combat. 6x E/P/D plus 5x Augment gives 1866 to 1878. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="Galatic Command">
   <li> Opening command crates at top of tier 1 to 3 (close to but before rank 80, 190, and 299) will give better drop rate. </li>
   <li> Each crate grants Command Tokens (CT), legacy wide and can be used to purchase Tier 1 (ir230) equipments on the fleet's Tier 1 equipment vendor. </li>
   <li> Disintegrate unwanted gear to get unassembled components (UC). PvP and GSF are the main UC sources. </li>
   <li> We can turn ir230, ir236, and ir242 gears into unassembled pieces with many UC. i.e. Take an ir230 chest plus UC to get Tier 2 unassembled chest. </li>
   <li> We also get unassembled pieces from operations.  Take the pieces to Tier 2-4 vendor to turn them into gear. i.e. Tier 2 unassembled chest can be turned into any ir236 chest. </li>
   <li> Only ir230, ir236, and ir242 gears can be upgraded.  Keep them as an option, as drop rate of <i>useful</i> ir248 is very low. </li>
   <li> When getting a gold armor/saber/focus that we already have, check whether its mod and enhancement can upgrade other gears. </li>
   <li> Focus's armoring can be placed on other armors, but that armor <i>will</i> lost its set bonus. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> It is strongly advised to unlock all four class buffs and all five companion bonus first. </li>
   <li> If we learn Biochem and train it to 600, we can craft (or buy) and use reusable consumables. </li>
   <li> Aim for 110% accuracy, 40% crit, and 7.15% alacrity first. Optimal arrangement takes some effort to meet. </li>
   <li> Accuracy/crit stim is a easy way to fill the stat budget, but I prefer mastery/power stim since I won't be dependent on it. </li>
   <li> Sever Force and Weaken Mind last a little bit longer than the <a href="#rotation">rotation</a> at all alacrity cutoff points, but the difference of cutting it, waiting it, or optimising for it is around 1%. So I just keep it simple. </li>
   <li> I haven't had time to test it, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/7upvqu/calculations_for_the_point_of_diminishing_returns/">some says</a> Critical's diminishing return is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/7z945a/lightning_spec_gearing_alacrity_crit_and_power/duorlx6/">around 2250</a> for us. Note that exact point varies from toon to toon. </li>
   <li> Set bonus - 2-set: Force Serenity gives +2% buff to damage; 4-set: Increase Telekinetic Throw's Force regen, reduce Mental Alacrity CD; 6-set: Add 1 charge to Force Potency. </li>
   <li> Set bonus does not affect rotation, except perhaps when to use Force Potency. </li>
   <li class="pvp"> PvP needs only 105% accuracy; I switch earpiece out for Alacrity, part of my healer gear. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Combat"> Combat </h2>

<h3 id="companion"> Companion </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Companion can be set to any role, which decides their abilities. For most fights, DPS role (same as us) make most combats fast and safe. </li>
   <li> Companion abilities can be excluded from auto-cast by right clicking the ability. The green box will go dark. </li>
   <li> When we disable non-attack abilities, they do more basic attacks and thus higher dps. </li>
   <li> DPS can stun, heal can cleanse, tank can pull; may disable these to increase dps and let us control when to use them and on whom. </li>
   <li> Use passive mode and Rescue to move companion out of AoE in boss fights. </li>
   <li> Use Heroic Effort to heal in hard fights, and Unity/Sacrifice if we have it. </li>
   <li> Fallen companions, self or of a teammate, can be revived in-combat like a PC. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> A companion with high influence rank fights pretty well. In heroics, flashpoints, and uprisings it is common to fill the team with high rank companions. </li>
   <li> Gift influence decrease as companion rank goes up. Dialogue and crew mission influence do not. It's preferable to fill first 15 to 20 levels with gifts first. </li>
   <li> Buy the companion gift bonus perks and lots of cheap $200 gifts ($250 for non-subs) from the fleet's trade section. Shift+Click to buy in batch. </li>
   <li> See <a href="https://torcommunity.com/guides/companions#influence-love">gift</a> <a href="http://dulfy.net/2015/10/21/swtor-fallen-empire-companion-influences-guide/#Companion_Gifts">guides</a> for which type to buy and how many. </li>
   <li> Get in and out of vehicle or rocket boost to fully recover companion hp out of combat. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tactic"> Tactics </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Never go first; we are ranged not melee. Always let companion or teammate attack first. Exceptions: pure Sage group or companion dies too fast. </li>
   <li> Combat Priority: mechanics / survival &gt; adds &gt; teammate rescue / control &gt; spending our main attacks &gt; self-heal &gt; rotation fillers</li>
   <li> Bubble and Rejuvenate self before fight starts. Optionally place a Phase Walk. Keep bubble up during the fight. </li>
   <li> When under fire, run behind cover to force the enemies to run around it for easy AoE. This is called LoS. </li>
   <li> Stock up on med packs. Cheaper than dying. Use stim at (close to) max level. Use adrenal in tough fights. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="solo">
   <li> Start fight by lifting the furthest or strongest enemy. LoS the rest, spread DoT, Quake the weaks and normals, focus fire the rest one by one. Interrupt and stun champions. </li>
   <li> Spread <a href="#damage_over_time">Damage over Time</a> and <a href="kiting">Kite</a> the enemies. </li>
   <li> Force Wave can be used more or less liberally, but try to group the enemies for AoE. </li>
   <li> Buy and eat Peppered Bantha Steak and Chilled Corellian Cocktail to increase hp regen and companion effectiveness. Check the fleet's Cantina Vendor. </li>
   <li> When we finish a fight with Telekinetic Throw, use the primed Vanquish to start next fight before it expire! </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="team">
   <li> Move last or second last (around/before healer).  Find and stay near cover before and during combat. </li>
   <li> In a big group I prefer to keep distance with others, away from AoE attacks, taking more self heal than AoE heal. </li>
   <li> The more we lift, the more our teammates are aware that we'll lift. </li>
   <li> Restrain on use of Force Wave and Rescue. They both change positioning, which is disruptive. </li>
   <li> DPS are generally not as important as tank or healer. Be understanding when we don't get resurrected. We help focus the heals on the survivors when we die! </li>
   <li> Use Cloud Mind often, even when we are not under attack, to keep our threat low. See its <a href="cloud_mind-notes">notes</a> for a story on that. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="respec">
   <li> Seer Sage is arguably the easiest heal spec to learn. </li>
   <li> It is recommended to learn it for flexibility in a team. </li>
   <li> Basics: Spam bubbles, cleanse debuffs, Rejuvenate to minor heal, Healing Trance to moderate heal, Rejuvenate + Roaming Mend to burst heal. Trance crits light up Vindicate, use to regain Force. </li>
   <li> Utilities: Always pick Force Mobility for mobile Healing Trance, our main heal.  Prefer survival options such as Egress and Mental Defense. </li>
   <li> For serious heal, healer's set bonus is pretty important.  We can wear 6 DPS set pieces and 1 healer piece, then we only need 5 healer gears to switch. </li>
</ul>


<h3 id="damage_over_time"> Damage over Time (DoT) </h3>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Our DoTs are heavy, often but not always our main damage output. </li>
   <li> Spread Weaken Mind and Sever Force to multiple foes to <i>multiply</i> our dps. </li>
   <li> Usually spread by Force in Balance, but put them on one by one when can't. </li>
   <li> After spreading DoT, use focus fire to take down enemy fast, i.e. Force in Balance and Force Serenity. </li>
   <li> When enemies are very weak or near death, just Quake, Throw, or Project. </li>
   <li> Enemies who hasn't been attacked by others will turn to us when we DoT them.  Be ready to LoS or endure their fire. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Spreadable DoTs deals ¼ to ⅕ dps of focus fire dps on <i>each</i> target. The more the targets the higher the total dps. </li>
   <li> Use LoS, push, or run into enemy pod to huddle up the enemies for easy spread. </li>
   <li> If you don't spread, don't play Balance; play Telekinetic instead. </li>
   <li> Our DoTs deals more damage on near death victims (hp &lt;= 30%), but should be placed early when they're healthier. </li>
   <li> Each damage is a "tick". Vanquish ticks faster, the others slower. </li>
   <li> High alacrity make DoTs ticks faster in a shorter duration, determined when placed. </li>
   <li> DoT ticks are indirect damage - no Force Potency but trigger and enjoy proc relic individually. </li>
   <li> Think our DoT feedback heals as relic proc chance instead of heals; they heal so little. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="kiting"> Kiting </h3>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Kiting is making opponent(s) run after us, always chasing but rarely or never catch us, like a kite. </li>
   <li> While they are chasing us, our DoTs and/or friends are hurting them. </li>
   <li> Very low dps; kiting is a slow war of attrition used when we would otherwise die too fast to see it through. </li>
   <li> Sage DPSs can't facetank and depends on kiting to survive hard fights. </li>
   <li> Run sideways when kiting, don't run forward or backward. This let us throws DoTs and other  attacks, but not run slow like backsteping. </li>
   <li> Keep the action up even when moving.  DoTs, Project, Force in Balance, Slow, Stun, Bubble, Rejuvenate. Revise utility to get even more. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Kiting is about damage control, about lowering dtps to a winnable level. </li>
   <li> If the foe is not immune, Force Stun, Force Lift, and Kinetic Collapse should be used with and preferred over kiting as damage control. </li>
   <li> Mainly for solo<span class="pvp"> and PvP</span>. In team PvE, let tankies go tank. </li>
   <li> Also applies when a boss is chasing us, because everyone else is down or mechanic reason. </li>
   <li> Kiting is not about not taking any damage.  We may take more damage than we deal.  As long as we can overcome the damage we take and our enemy can't, it is working. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="kite_common"> General Kitings </h4>
<ul summary="Melee Kiting">
   <li> Run in circle around a cover, throw AoE before our kite clears the corners, deal DoTs and instant attacks when it poke out, then flee behind cover and self heal. Rinse and repeat. </li>
   <li> Melee enemies often move faster than us and can jump to us, called a gap close. </li>
   <li> After being jumped, Force Speed to another cover to put some distance, and use the chance to Force Serenity or Telekinetic Throw. </li>
   <li> Use Force Slow, Confound, and other crowd controls if the foe is not immune. </li>
   <li> Ethereal Entity is our only way to be immune from gap close, and can buy us valuable time to pepper the enemy with casted and channeled attacks. </li>
   <li> Either set companion to heal so that (s)he doesn't draw the enemy away, or let him/her die and kite alone. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="Ranged Kiting">
   <li> Common form is same as kiting melee, except ranged foes don't have gap closer but often have AoE. </li>
   <li> Some ranged NPCs have casted attack; immediately run behind cover so that it fails, then poke out and attack. </li>
   <li> Some encounters do not give us any place to hide. In this case kite at 30m range - get in range, deal DoTs, then flee and let the foe chase us. </li>
   <li> The 30m kiting also works on melees without gap closers. </li>
   <li> Preferably we run in a big circle on the map. When we can't, Force Speed from one end of the map to another like a pendulum. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="kite_special"> Special Kitings </h4>
<ul summary="LoS Kiting">
   <li> A special form of kiting when there is a big steam of trashes or adds that keep coming and coming. </li>
   <li> They always land at a fixed location.  Trigger the encounter, then run back far and behind a cover. </li>
   <li> The NPCs will come chase us.  This takes time, time for us to take the wave down, heal up, and cooldown for next wave. </li>
   <li> Use passive mode to stop companion from chasing them. Ranged companions preferred. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="Facetank Kiting">
   <li> Sometimes nothing else works.  For me this is KotFE Chapter VIII's platform fight with the Zakuul captain, on master mode, where she jumps and empty my hp in two to three hits. </li>
   <li> We can stack our DCDs: Unity (50% 15s), Advanced Polybiotic Shielding Adrenal (30% 15s), Blockout (30% 6s), Ethereal Entity (30% ?s), Valorous Spirit (15% 6s), Rejuvenate (5% 9s). </li>
   <li> We must still kite. Apply DoTs, run, DCDs right before she catches us, facetank a few seconds, Phase Walk and self heal, refresh DoT when she comes again, finally Force Barrier. </li>
   <li> Note that Blockout may direct the enemy's attention to our companion, instead of serving as a DCD! </li>
   <li> Also useful: Heroic Moment, Life Ward, Swift Rejuvenation. Medkits and stims assumed. </li>
</ul>


<h3 id="interface"> Interface and keybinds </h3>

<p>
Some tips for setting up swtor interface for best Balance Sage experience.
</p>

<h4 id="gui"> Interface </h4>
<ul>
   <li> Go preferred or subscription.  Preferred get four ability bars (sub six), enough for all class abilities plus a few more.
   You don't need to <i>hotkey</i> all abilities, but no class abilities are useless (except Saber Strike). </li>
   <li> Use team interface for non-op teams.  They show companion which may need our supports too. </li>
   <li> Enable "Highlight own effects" in target debuff bar, and scale it up.
   It let us see whether <i>our</i> DoTs and debuffs are on the target. </li>
   <li> Do the same to own and friends' debuff bars.
   With big debuff icons we can identify bubble/revive/raid-buff timer and cleansable debuffs. </li>
   <li> Enable Focus Target and do the same. Use it to monitor our DoT on the boss and its actions. </li>
   <li> I sort all buffs and debuffs - own, friends, foes - by total duration, so that the same effect always go to the same place. </li>
   <li> Scale up target and focus target cast bars until you can easily see the action text.
   Target yourself and Medidate to see the bar in interface editor.</li>
   <li> Global scaling is independent from component scales, and should be set before fine tuning individual blocks. </li>
</ul >

<h4 id="keybind"> Keybindings </h4>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Move forward and strafe with keyboard, turn with mouse drag, attack with hotkeys, select target with mouse or hotkey. </li>
   <li> Life savers like Mind Snap, Force Barrier, Phase Walk, med packs should be placed on quick and accurate keys. </li>
   <li> Kiting abilities (DoTs, Force in Balance, Force Speed, Stun, Slow etc.) should be bound to a key we can press on the move. </li>
   <li> Telekinetic Throw, Bubble, Force Mend, Rejuvenate are used a lot, and should have secondary priority (e.g. Shift modified). </li>
   <li> Benevolence, Force Empowerment, Meditate, Rescue, Revival, Vindicate these are rarely used and may be put on hard keys or no keys. </li>
   <li> The rest such as Mental Alacrity, Force Potency goes in between (e.g. Ctrl modified or far away but not too difficult). </li>
   <li> Don't need to <i>hotkey</i> every ability, but class abilities and combat abilities (Heroic Effort, medkits etc.) should be on the bars. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Controls and keybindings are very personal. Experiment to find the scheme that suits you. </li>
   <li> I bind ESDF to move, (Shift/Ctrl)+AZXCVBGTR12345 to abilities, F1-F6 to DCDs, 6-0 to companion, `TabQW to targeting. </li>
   <li> I also assign easy keys to bubble and heals so that I don't need to shuffle them when I respec to Seer. </li>
   <li> You may or may not go to this extreme; only you can decide what works best for you. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="glossary"> Glossary </h2>
<dl>
   <dt> Adds </dt>
   <dd> Additional NPCs that arrive as reinforcement in the middle of a boss fight.  Usually should be taken down asap. </dd>

   <dt> AoE </dt>
   <dd> Area of Effect, abilities that act on the desginated area instead of specific target(s). Usually the more the target the merrier. Some AoEs are continuous and need the target to stay inside (e.g. Force Quake), but most are not. AoE are always circle or cone. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Cc]ast(?:ed)?"> Cast </dt>
   <dd> Casted abilities require us to stand still for a while to finish casting and take effect. They can be interrupted by crowd controls, and pressing Esc, moving, or using another ability also abort the casting. Damage we take during cast will pushback the cast bar, thus increasing total cast time. Force Serenity and Benevolence are casted. Alacrity shorten most cast times, and passive/utilities may allow a casted ability to be used while on the move. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Cc]hannel(?:ed)?"> Channel </dt>
   <dd> Channelled abilities require us to stand still to use and deliver its effect in stages.  They can be interrupted by crowd controls, and pressing Esc, moving, or using another ability also ends them early.  Telekinetic Throw and Force Quake are channelled. Alacrity shorten most channel times, quickening their effects. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Cc]hapters?"> Chapters </dt>
   <dd> Although the class stories and early expansions are split into chapters, endgame chapter specifically means KotFE/KotET chapters which can be replayed again and again in various difficulties. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Cc]leans(?:es?|ing)"> Cleanse </dt>
   <dd> Healie's ability to remove up to two debuffs. Sage can clear Mental/Force debuffs and Scoundrel/Commando can clear Physical/Tech. Healers can additionlly clear both Physical and Mental. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="(?:[Cc]ooldown|CD)"> Cooldown (CD) </dt>
   <dd> Most abilities has a coodown period of a few seconds to a few minutes during which it cannot be used again. Note that some abilities like Revival and med kits can only be used once per fight. Most cooldowns are non-fixed and can be reduced by Alacrity. </dd>

   <dt> DCD </dt>
   <dd> Defensive Cooldown. Powerful defensive abilities with a fixed cooldown. Sages' are Force Barrier, and Force Mend/Cloud Mind/Phase Walk with utilities. Rejuvenate and bubble can be always on, and are not normally considered DCD. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Dd]ebuffs?"> Debuff </dt>
   <dd> Harmful effects applied to self, including as DoT, slow, damage vulnerability, and other bad status. Some debuffs can be removed by cleanse abilities, and almost all can be removed by purge. </dd>

   <dt> DoT </dt>
   <dd> Damage over Time. DoTs attacks "stick" on the target for their durations and deals damage at regular interval without requiring further actions. Each damage is called a "tick". </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="(?:dps|[rm]?DPSs?)"> DPS </dt>
   <dd> Has two meanings; in this guide, all caps "DPS" means characters in the damage role (rDPS = ranged, mDPS = melee), and lowercase "dps" mean Damage Per Second, a key performance metric for these DPSs. High dps means high damage output. All classes can be DPS; StarParse collects operation <a href="http://ixparse.com/rating/">dps stats</a>. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="dtps"> DTPS </dt>
   <dd> Damage taken over Time. NPC attacks do fixed damage, but when we use kiting to delay and scatter these damages, DTPS falls, giving us time to heal and our DoTs time to work. </dd>

   <dt> Endgame </dt>
   <dd> The part of the game that happens at close to max level, where gearing and skill improvement replaces rapid level and ability growth. Mainly PvP, master mode flashpoints/uprisings/chapters, a few high level planets, and operation in all modes. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="e?hps"> (E)HPS </dt>
   <dd> (Effective) Heal Per Second, a key performance metric for healers. High (e)hps means high healing. Overheal is counted into hps but not ehps. StarParse collects operation <a href="http://ixparse.com/rating/">ehps stats</a>. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Ff]lashpoints?"> Flashpoints (fp) </dt>
   <dd> Sometime called Dungeons, flashpoints are side-story team PvE activities for up to four players that take roughly half an hour to complete.

   <dt data-regexp="(?:off-)GCDs?"> GCD </dt>
   <dd> Global Cooldown. Most abilities put us on a short 1.5s cooldown during which we cannot use next ability. Alacrity can shorten GCD and thus increase action speed. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Hh]eal(?:er)?s?"> Heal </dt>
   <dd> The act or role of healing, cleansing, and reviving fallen teammates. Responsible for saving team from mistakes, critical in sustained fights. Effective heals generate threat on all NPCs, so DPSs and tanks must keep them off the healers. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Hh]ealies?"> Healie </dt>
   <dd> Advanced classes that can spec into heal and have some healings even as DPS. The republic has Sage, Smuggler, and Commando. Of these, smuggler is melee but can heal at range. </dd>

   <dt> HoT </dt>
   <dd> Heal over Time. HoTs "stick" on the target for their durations and heals at regular interval without requiring further actions.  </dd>

   <dt> LoS </dt>
   <dd> Line of Sight.  The technique of hiding behind covers (tall boxes, pillars, doorways, wall corners) to block their attacks through line of sight, and lure them to group up at the corner. </dd>

   <dt> Mez </dt>
   <dd> Short of mesmerize. Commonly known as soft CC, a kind of Crowd Control that disables the target for a long duration or until they take <i>any</i> damage.  Some AoEs ignore mez and can be safely used, but ours are passive so we must take care when we AoE. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Oo]ff-[Hh]eal"> Off-Heal </dt>
   <dd> Healie classes in DPS specs who can heal a bit. That means us. Off-heals lack lacks proper healing abilities and can only help a bit. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Oo]ff-[Tt]ank"> Off-Tank </dt>
   <dd> Often used in an operation to refer to the non-main tank. Tanky classes are usually called off-tank too, but non-tank specs lack proper tanking abilities and can only help a bit. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Oo]perations?|[Rr]aids?"> Operations (op) </dt>
   <dd> Also called Raid, operations are ultimate endgame PvE contents normally done in 8 or 16 person group, and require decent to very high skill and gear to complete. </dd>

   <dt> Proc </dt>
   <dd> Randomly triggered events, or the triggering of these events.  Commonly seen on relics, but every class has some proc passives. Sometimes loosely used to describe all activated effects (random or not), such as saying Telekinetic Throw procs Vanquish. </dd>

   <dd> An ability that removes all debuffs from self.  For Sages it is Force Barrier. </dd>

   <dt> PvE </dt>
   <dd> Player verse Environment. The part of the game where we compete with NPC enemies instead of real players.  Class missions, planet missions, heroics, flashpoints, uprisings, operations, and expasion chapters are all PvE. </dd>

   <dt> PvP </dt>
   <dd> Player verse Player. The part of the game where we compete with real players instead of NPC enemies. Duels, warzones, and open world PvP are all PvP. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Rr]e-?[Ss]pec"> Re-Spec </dt>
   <dd> Switching to another spec, usually changing character role such as from DPS to heal or vice versa. Respec often implies rearranging abilities and switching gear, esp. when switching role. </dd>

   <dt> Rotation </dt>
   <dd> Rotations are ability sequences that lead to optimal synergies and outputs, such as dps or hps. Proc based discipline such as Telekinetic use a priority rotation.  Others such as Balance use a repetitive or segmented rotation. </dd>

   <dt> Sap </dt>
   <dd> A special form of mez that can only be used in stealth and on an organic target. Usually used to bypass enemies without alerting them.  We have none since we can't stealth. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Ss]pecs?"> Spec </dt>
   <dd> Called "Discipline" in swtor, spec is a fixed skill tree in one of the three roles. Each advanced class has three specs, and a character perk allows in-field respec which make it possible to switch role anytime. </dd>

   <dt> Stun </dt>
   <dd> Also known as Hard CC, a kind of Crowd Control that stops all actions of the target for a short duration. e.g. Project can stun weak and standard enemies. </dd>

   <!-- <dt> swtor </dt>
   <dd> Star Wars: The Old Re<span>pub</span>lic, somtimes simply Tor.  A Star Wars MMO game set thousands of years before the movies, when Jedi and Sith were more abundant and lightsabers less powerful. </dd> -->

   <dt> Tank </dt>
   <dd> The act or role of taking point and taunting enemies to draw their fire away from teammates. Tanks has many DCDs and usually stack defensive stats to endure the damage. The most heroic role in any team. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Tt]ank(?:y|ies)"> Tanky </dt>
   <dd> Advanced classes that can spec into tank and have some taunts even as DPS. The republic has Guardian, Shadow, and Vanguard. All tankies are melee. </dd>

   <dt> Threat </dt>
   <dd> In PvE combat, every time we attack or heal we are threatening the NPCs, represented by creating a numeric threat. Each NPC keep a list of who is threatening it, a threat table, and will attack (aggro) the one who made the most threat. <br/> There is no threat in PvP; players decide who to attack. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Tt]icks?"> Tick </dt>
   <dd> Each stage of channelled abilities, DoTs, and HoTs is a tick. Force Quakes has 4 ticks, 3 of which deals damage. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Tt]rash(?: [Mm]obs?)"> Trash Mobs </dt>
   <dd> Non-boss fight NPC enemies. Usually a small group of low difficulty NPCs standing on the way waiting to be defeated.
        In map design terms they make moving between boss fights less boring, and make the boss fight more dramatic in comparison.
        Note that some (very rare) encounters have so much trashes that they are essentially boss fights, e.g. Landing Party uprising's Zakuulan Ambush. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Uu]prisings?"> Uprisings </dt>
   <dd> No-dialogue team PvE activities for up to four players, like a short flashpoint.  No less deadly but drop a lot less rewards so few players run them. </dd>
