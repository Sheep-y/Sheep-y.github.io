Spam Force Lightning so that we can use Demolish on cooldown too. </li><li> "Off-heal" with Bubble, but keep it minimal in combat. Use Expunge to self-cleanse. Use Reanimation in-combat if necessary. </li><li> Maintain self bubble, and use Unnatural Preservation to self heal. Force Speed and flee when hp drops fast.

Rinse and repeat. </li><li> Melee enemies often move faster than us and can jump to us, called a gap close. </li><li> After being jumped, Force Speed to another cover to put some distance, and use the chance to Force Leach or Force Lightning. </li><li> Use Force Slow, Conspiring Force, and other crowd controls if the foe is not immune. </li><li> Shifting Silhouette is our only way to be immune from gap close, and can buy us valuable time to pepper the enemy with casted and channeled attacks. </li><li> Either set companion to heal so that (s)he doesn't draw the enemy away, or let him/her die and kite alone. </li></ul></details><details open="open"><summary>Ranged Kiting</summary><ul summary="Ranged Kiting"><li> Common form is same as kiting melee, except ranged foes don't have gap closer but often have AoE. </li><li> Some ranged NPCs have casted attack; immediately run behind cover so that it fails, then poke out and attack. </li><li> Some encounters do not give us any place to hide. In this case kite at 30m range - get in range, deal DoTs, then flee and let the foe chase us. </li><li> The 30m kiting also works on melees without gap closers. </li><li> Preferably we run in a big circle on the map. When we can't, Force Speed from one end of the map to another like a pendulum. </li></ul></details></details><details h="h4" id="kite_special" open="open"><summary>Special Kitings</summary><details open="open"><summary>LoS Kiting</summary><ul summary="LoS Kiting"><li> A special form of kiting when there is a big steam of trashes or adds that keep coming and coming. </li><li> They always land at a fixed location.  Trigger the encounter, then run back far and behind a cover. </li><li> The NPCs will come chase us.  This takes time, time for us to take the wave down, heal up, and cooldown for next wave. </li><li> Use passive mode to stop companion from chasing them. Ranged companions preferred. </li></ul></details><details open="open"><summary>Vertical Kiting</summary><ul summary="Vertical Kiting"><li> A special form of kiting when the battleground has multi-levels, typically connected by stairs. </li><li> Plant a Phase Walk at the level above or below from the enemies.  If there are multiples, put it closer to one stair than the other(s) to funnel the foes. </li><li> Instead of a running fight like normal kiting, we can fight for as long as it is safe to do. </li><li> When it's no longer safe, Phase Walk and patch up. The enemies will use the stair, giving us some quiet time. NPCs always move on solid ground; they never jump. </li><li> If one trip is not enough, kite around the stairs until it cooldowns; most of these maps has multiple stairs that make it easy for us to kite in a vertical circle. </li><li> If there is no stair and the enemies are below us, we can return to upper level but they can't follow us. Heal to full before dropping down again to finish them off. </li><li> On some maps we can jump down to lower level instead of Phase Walk. The falling damage may make it less feasible, but falling has no cooldown. </li></ul></details><details open="open"><summary>Facetank Kiting</summary><ul summary="Facetank Kiting"><li> Sometimes nothing else works.  For me this is KotFE Chapter VIII's platform fight with the Zakuul captain, on master mode, who jumps and empties my hp in two to three hits. </li><li> We can stack our DCDs: Unity (50% 15s), Advanced Polybiotic Shielding Adrenal (30% 15s), Supression (30% 6s), Shifting Silhouette (30% ?s), Unnatural Vigor (15% 6s), Resurgense (5% 9s). </li><li> We must still kite. Apply DoTs, run, DCDs right before she catches us, facetank a few seconds, Phase Walk and self heal, refresh DoT when she comes again, finally Force Barrier. </li><li> Note that Supression may direct the enemy's attention to our companion, instead of serving as a DCD! </li><li> Also useful: Heroic Moment, Corrupted Barrier, Galvanizing Cleanse. Medkits and stims assumed. </li></ul></details></details></details><details h="h3" id="interface" open="open"><summary>Interface and keybinds</summary><p> Some tips for setting up swtor interface for best Madness Sorcerer experience. </p><details h="h4" id="gui" open="open"><summary>Interface</summary><ul><li> Go preferred or subscribe.

They show companion which may need our supports too. </li><li> Enable "Highlight own effects" in target debuff bar, and scale it up. It let us see whether <i>our</i> DoTs and debuffs are on the target. </li><li> Enable Focus Target and do the same. Use it to monitor our DoT on the boss and its casts/channels. </li><li> Also enlarge own and friends' debuff icons, so that we can identify bubble/revive/raid-buff timer and cleansable debuffs. </li><li> I sort all buffs and debuffs - own, friends, foes - by total duration, so that combat effects always go first and class buff always go last. </li><li> Scale up target and focus target cast bars until you can easily see the action text.

Usually should be taken down asap. </dd><dt> AoE </dt><dd> Area of Effect, abilities that act on the desginated area instead of specific target(s). Usually the more the target the merrier. Some AoEs are continuous and need the target to stay inside (e.g. Force Storm), but most are not. AoE are always circle or cone. </dd><dt> APM </dt><dd> Action Per Minute, a key indicator of action efficiency. High APM means more actions were done, implying higher numbers. The "perfect" APM is 40 at 1.5s GCD, ~43 at 1.4s GCD, ~46 at 1.4 GCD, but lag typically reduces these numbers by 2. In real combat, time spent on movement, targeting, thinking, or simply waiting will reduce APM, while Off-GCD actions increase APM. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Aa]utocrits?"> Autocrits </dt><dd> Most classes has abilities that automatically deal critical damage or heal on some conditions. These are called autocrits. Autocrits are almost always supercrits. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Cc]ast(?:ed)?"> Cast </dt><dd> Casted abilities require us to stand still for a while to finish casting and take effect. They can be interrupted by crowd controls, and pressing Esc, moving, or using another ability also abort the casting. Damage we take during cast will pushback the cast bar, thus increasing total cast time. Force Leach and Dark Heal are casted. Alacrity shorten most cast times, and passive/utilities may allow a casted ability to be used while on the move. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Cc]hannel(?:ed)?"> Channel </dt><dd> Channelled abilities require us to stand still to use and deliver its effect in stages.  They can be interrupted by crowd controls, and pressing Esc, moving, or using another ability also ends them early.  Force Lightning and Force Storm are channelled. Alacrity shorten most channel times, quickening their effects. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Cc]hapters?"> Chapters </dt><dd> Although the class stories and early expansions are split into chapters, endgame chapter specifically means KotFE/KotET chapters which can be replayed again and again in various difficulties. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Cc]leans(?:es?|ing)"> Cleanse </dt><dd> Healie's ability to remove up to two debuffs. Sorcerer can clear Mental/Force debuffs and Operative/Mercenary can clear Physical/Tech. Healers can additionlly clear both Physical and Mental. </dd><dt data-regexp="(?:[Cc]ooldown|CD)"> Cooldown (CD) </dt><dd> Most abilities has a coodown period of a few seconds to a few minutes during which it cannot be used again. Most cooldowns are non-fixed and can be reduced by Alacrity. </dd><dt> DCD </dt><dd> Defensive Cooldown. Powerful defensive abilities with a fixed cooldown. Sages' are Force Barrier, and Unnatural Preservation/Cloud Mind/Phase Walk with utilities. Resurgense and bubble can be always on, and are not normally considered DCD. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Dd]ebuffs?"> Debuff </dt><dd> Harmful effects applied to self, including as DoT, slow, damage vulnerability, and other bad status. Some debuffs can be removed by cleanse abilities, and almost all can be removed by purge. </dd><dt> DoT </dt><dd> Damage over Time. DoTs attacks "stick" on the target for their durations and deals damage at regular interval without requiring further actions. Each damage is called a "tick". </dd><dt data-regexp="(?:dps|[rm]?DPSs?)"> DPS </dt><dd> Has two meanings; in this guide, all caps "DPS" means characters in the damage role (rDPS = ranged, mDPS = melee), and lowercase "dps" mean Damage Per Second, a key performance metric for these DPSs. High dps means high damage output. All classes can be DPS; StarParse collects operation <a href="http://ixparse.com/rating/">dps stats</a>. </dd><dt data-regexp="dtps"> DTPS </dt><dd> Damage taken over Time. NPC attacks do fixed damage, but when we use kiting to delay and scatter these damages, DTPS falls, giving us time to heal and our DoTs time to work. </dd><dt> Endgame </dt><dd> The part of the game that happens at close to max level, where gearing and skill improvement replaces rapid level and ability growth. Mainly PvP, master mode flashpoints/uprisings/chapters, a few high level planets, and operation in all modes. </dd><dt data-regexp="e?hps"> (E)HPS </dt><dd> (Effective) Heal Per Second, a key performance metric for healers. High (e)hps means high healing. Overheal is counted into hps but not ehps. StarParse collects operation <a href="http://ixparse.com/rating/">ehps stats</a>. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Ff]lashpoints?"> Flashpoints (fp) </dt><dd> Sometime called Dungeons, flashpoints are side-story team PvE activities for up to four players that take roughly half an hour to complete.  A quick way to level up, meet new friends, and get social points. Story mode is for solo, Veteran mode is for learning, and master mode is a challenge. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Cc]rowd [Cc]ontrols?"> Crowd Control (CC) </dt><dd> Abilities that disable enemies such as stun, mez, sap, and push (over cliffs).  The literal definition, uncommon in the game, includes general pull, push, interrupts, LoS, and perhaps AoEs. </dd><dt data-regexp="(?:off-)GCDs?"> GCD </dt><dd> Global Cooldown. Most abilities put us on a short 1.5s cooldown during which we cannot use next ability. Alacrity can shorten GCD and thus increase action speed. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Hh]eal(?:er)?s?"> Heal </dt><dd> The act or role of healing, cleansing, and reviving fallen teammates. Responsible for saving team from mistakes, critical in sustained fights. Effective heals generate threat on all NPCs, so DPSs and tanks must keep them off the healers. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Hh]ealies?"> Healie </dt><dd> Advanced classes that can spec into heal and have some healings even as DPS. The republic has Sorcerer, Imperial Agent, and Mercenary. Of these, smuggler is melee but can heal at range. </dd><dt> HoT </dt><dd> Heal over Time. HoTs "stick" on the target for their durations and heals at regular interval without requiring further actions. </dd><dt data-regexp="ir2\d\d"> Item Rating </dt><dd> Every wearable gear has an "item rating", a numerical measurement of the item's power level. For example ir230 and beyond are classified as endgame gears. </dd><dt> LoS </dt><dd> Line of Sight.  The technique of hiding behind covers (tall boxes, pillars, doorways, wall corners) to block their attacks through line of sight, and lure them to group up at the corner. </dd><dt> Mez </dt><dd> Short of mesmerize. Commonly known as soft CC, a kind of Crowd Control that disables the target for a long duration or until they take <i>any</i> damage.  Some AoEs ignore mez and can be safely used, but ours are passive so we must take care when we AoE. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Oo]ff-[Hh]eal"> Off-Heal </dt><dd> Healie classes in DPS specs who can heal a bit. That means us. Off-heals lack lacks proper healing abilities and can only help a bit. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Oo]ff-[Tt]ank"> Off-Tank </dt><dd> Often used in an operation to refer to the non-main tank. Tanky classes are usually called off-tank too, but non-tank specs lack proper tanking abilities and can only help a bit. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Oo]perations?|[Rr]aids?"> Operations (op) </dt><dd> Also called Raid, operations are ultimate endgame PvE contents normally done in 8 or 16 person group, and require decent to very high skill and gear to complete. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Pp]assives?"> Passives </dt><dd> Passive abilities constantly enhances or upgrades our stats or abilities, and cannot be "activated" alone like active abilities. </dd><dt> Pin </dt><dd> Immobilise effects - effects that prevents the victim from moving.  Unless it is a hindering effect, pins won't prevent escape by pull, jump, or teleportation. </dd><dt> Proc </dt><dd> Randomly triggered events, or the triggering of these events.  Commonly seen on relics, but every class has some proc passives. Sometimes loosely used to describe all activated effects (random or not), such as saying Force Lightning procs Demolish. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Pp]urges?"> Purge </dt><dd> An ability that removes all debuffs from self.  For Sages it is Force Barrier. </dd><dt> PvE </dt><dd> Player verse Environment. The part of the game where we compete with NPC enemies instead of real players.  Class missions, planet missions, heroics, flashpoints, uprisings, operations, and expasion chapters are all PvE. </dd><dt> PvP </dt><dd> Player verse Player. The part of the game where we compete with real players instead of NPC enemies. Duels, warzones, and open world PvP are all PvP. </dd><dt> Pushback </dt><dd> Ok, I'm part of a cross-gulid Chinese raid team, and we're looking for one more teammate in any role, preferably on both sides. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Rr]e-?[Ss]pec"> Re-Spec </dt><dd> Switching to another spec, usually changing character role such as from DPS to heal or vice versa. Respec often implies rearranging abilities and switching gear, esp. when switching role. </dd><dt> Rotation </dt><dd> Rotations are ability sequences that lead to optimal synergies and outputs, such as dps or hps. Proc based discipline such as Lightning use a priority rotation.  Others such as Madness use a repetitive or segmented rotation. </dd><dt> Sap </dt><dd> A special form of mez that can only be used in stealth and on an organic target. Usually used to bypass enemies without alerting them.  We have none since we can't stealth. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Ss]pecs?"> Spec </dt><dd> Called "Discipline" in swtor, spec is a fixed skill tree in one of the three roles. Each advanced class has three specs, and a character perk allows in-field respec which make it possible to switch role anytime. </dd><dt> Stun </dt><dd> Also known as Hard CC, a kind of Crowd Control that stops all actions of the target for a short duration. e.g. Shock can stun weak and standard enemies. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Ss]upercrits?"> Supercrits </dt><dd> When an attack's critical chance is above 100%, crit will 100% happen, and the remaining critical chance becomes bonus damage. For example if we have 40% crit rate and 70% crit damage, an autocrit at 140% crit rate will do 110% crit damage, i.e. doubling the normal damage. </dd><dt> Tank </dt><dd> The act or role of taking point and taunting enemies to draw their fire away from teammates. Tanks has many DCDs and usually stack defensive stats to endure the damage. The most heroic role in any team. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Tt]ank(?:y|ies)"> Tanky </dt><dd> Advanced classes that can spec into tank and have some taunts even as DPS. The republic has Juggernaut, Assassin, and Power Tech. All tankies are melee. </dd><dt> Threat </dt><dd> In PvE combat, every time we attack or heal we are threatening the NPCs, represented by creating a numeric threat. Each NPC keep a list of who is threatening it, a threat table, and will attack (aggro) the one who made the most threat. <br/> There is no threat in PvP; players decide who to attack. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Tt]icks?"> Tick </dt><dd> Each stage of channelled abilities, DoTs, and HoTs is a tick. Force Quakes has 4 ticks, 3 of which deals damage. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Tt]rash(?: [Mm]obs?)"> Trash Mobs </dt><dd> Non-boss fight NPC enemies. Usually a small group of low difficulty NPCs standing on the way waiting to be defeated. In map design terms they make moving between boss fights less boring, and make the boss fight more dramatic in comparison. Note that some (very rare) encounters have so much trashes that they are essentially boss fights, e.g. Landing Party uprising's Zakuulan Ambush. </dd><dt data-regexp="[Uu]prisings?"> Uprisings </dt><dd> No-dialogue team PvE activities for up to four players, like a short flashpoint.  No less deadly but drop a lot less rewards so few players run them. </dd></dl></details></article><script class="imp"> var guide_config = { spec: 'madness', specMirror: 'balance', baseClassAbbr: 'si', baseClassMirrorAbbr: 'jc', baseClassMirror: 'Jedi Consular' , advClassMirror: 'Sage' }; </script><script src="../res/basic.js"></script><script src="../res/guide.js"></script></body></html>
