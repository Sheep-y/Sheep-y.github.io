<h2 id="intro"> Balance Sage: Overview </h2>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Lighted robed, lightsaber wielding, seeks wisdom and allies over action. </li>
   <li class="pub"> Story highlights: Recover artifacts, form alliances and armies as a Jedi Master, join the Jedi Council, make a holocron. </li>
   <li class="imp"> Story highlights: Learn dark rituals, gather  Sith ghosts, duel a Darth before joining the Dark Council. </li>
   <li> Spec: Ranged, DoT DPS, Jedi (Force-user), off-heal. </li>
   <li> Pros: mobility, AoE, self heal, team support. </li>
   <li> Cons: few defences, lack of burst. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Hardest Sage discipline, excels at kiting and long fights. </li>
   <li> Stable rotation, zero proc dependency, very reliable relic proc. </li>
   <li> Self-heals give us great stamina in a long fight, but we have few ways to survive burst damage. </li>
   <li> Telekinetic is Sage's burst DPS spec, easier to play and shares same gear. </li>
   <li> Seer is Sage's heal spec, very versatile and efficient, but uses different gear. </li>

<h2 id="rotation"> Rotations </h2>

<h3 id="rotation_simple"> Elle's Very Simple Rotation </h3>
<ol class="key">
   <li> Vanquish (Pre-cast/instant) </li>
   <li> Sever Force </li>
   <li> Weaken Mind </li>
   <li> Force in Balance (Spread DoT) </li>
   <li> Force Serenity </li>
   <li> Telekinetic Throw (Full cast) </li>
   <li> Disturbance </li>
   <li> Telekinetic Throw (Full cast) </li>
   <li> Telekinetic Throw (Clipped, throw vanquish asap) </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> When dummy parsing, simply repeat it over and over. </li>
   <li> You can move around during steps 1 to 4 (or 1 to 5 with utilities); find a safe place to throw skittles. </li>
   <li> If rotation can't keep up with Vanquish's cooldown, skip the last Telekinetic Throw. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rotation_exp"> Expanded Rotation </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> (Open) (If mid-fight &amp; Vanquish not primed) Telekinetic Throw </li>
   <li> (Off) Mental Alacrity </li>
   <li> 0.0s Vanquish / Mind Crush (Pre-cast/instant) </li>
   <li> 1.5s Sever Force </li>
   <li> 3.0s Weaken Mind </li>
   <li> (Off) Force Potency </li>
   <li> 4.5s Force in Balance (Spread DoTs at lv. 28+)</li>
   <li> (Off) Force Mend</li>
   <li> 6.0s Force Serenity (Project before lv. 40) </li>
   <li> 7.5s Telekinetic Throw (Full cast) </li>
   <li> 9.6s Disturbance (Instant) or Rejuvenate</li>
   <li> (Off) Cloud Mind </li>
   <li> 11.1s Telekinetic Throw (Full cast) </li>
   <li> 13.2s Telekinetic Throw (Clipped; skip before lv 56.) or bubble </li>
   <li> 14.7s Next rotation. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Everything after first Telekinetic Throw are fillers, but it's best to do one more Telekinetic Throw to maintain the buffs. </li>
   <li> Off-GCD ability is best queued after instant ability, before GCD finishes, together with next ability for lowest delay. </li>
   <li> Mental Alacrity must be before Vanquish for maximum throughput. </li>
   <li> Use Force Empowerment after Mental Alacrity for boss or burn phase. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="rotation_aoe"> AoE Rotation </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Sever Force or Weaken Mind </li>
   <li> (Optional) Weaken Mind or Sever Force </li>
   <li> Force in Balance (DoT spread) </li>
   <li> Force Quake </li>
   <li> Force Quake </li>
   <li> Switch to single target </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Use experience to judge whether to put one DoT or two, and which. </li>
   <li> Force in Balance is our heaviest AoE, equals a full Force Quake at one DoT, slightly above at two. </li>
   <li> If the situation allows, use Force Push to push opponents together for Force in Balance. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="attacks"> Main Attacks </h3>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Dealing damage is our main job. </li>
   <li> Basic Attack: Telekinetic Throw (regen Force). </li>
   <li> Use on cooldown: Vanquish, Force in Balance, Force Serenity. </li>
   <li> Never hardcast Vanquish except to start a fight. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-1"> Telekinetic Throw </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Zero-cooldown basic attack, good damage and give us force, but can't use on move. </li>
   <li> 4 hits (a full channel) make next Vanquish and Disturbance instant cast and do higher damage at less force (last 15s). </li>
   <li> Each hits also buff DoT crit chance by 2% (max 8%, last 10s). </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Whenever we can stay still and big powers are on CD; priming Vanquish is very important. </li>
   <li> Finish off near death trash mobs and adds. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Ticks immediately and then twice per second, 4 ticks total. </li>
   <li> Immune to pushback. </li>
   <li> Hits does not need to be continuous for the buffs; can run, hit twice, run, hit twice. </li>
   <li> Each tick will consumes a Force Potency, which is <i>very</i> wasteful. </li>
   <li> At level 40, each tick has 20% chance to trigger Rippling Force which immediately deals around half tick damage and can crit. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-29"> Vanquish </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Our biggest attack, good upfront (burst) damage, heaviest and quickest tick. (tick per 1s) </li>
   <li> Always use after primed by Throw. 25% damage on our biggest attack. </li>
   <li> Make target vulnerable 5% to Force damage. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Hardcast to start a combat. This is an exception to no hardcast rule. </li>
   <li> Use on cooldown.  Telekinetic Throw often and save the buff to be used on cooldown. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Ticks once per seconds for 9 seconds, 9 ticks total after upfront damage. </li>
   <li> Upfront damage is not DoT tick and does not enjoy DoT buffs. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-27"> Sever Force </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Long lasting DoT, spreadable by Force in Balance. </li>
   <li> Pin victim on a hidden cooldown of 9 seconds. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Whenever the target is not going to fall in a few seconds or so. </li>
   <li> DoT spreading by Force in Balance or manually. </li>
   <li> To start a fight on a melee foes when its friends are ranged, so that they stay together for easy DoT spread. </li>
   <li> To prevent kiting opponent from closing or jumping on us. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Ticks immediately and once per 3 seconds for 18 seconds, 7 ticks total. </li>
   <li> Deals internal (yellow) damage, which bypass many defences. </li>
   <li> Cost only half the Force of Weaken Mind, and should be preferred over it. </li>
   <li> Heals us 10% of the damage dealt (lv. 52+), very little even when spread. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-7"> Weaken Mind </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Long lasting DoT, spreadable by Force in Balance. </li>
   <li> Does not pin target, sometimes good for DoT spread. </li>
   <li> Victim takes great bonus damage from Force Serenity. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Whenever the target is not going to fall in a few seconds or so. </li>
   <li> DoT spreading by Force in Balance or manually. </li>
   <li> To start a fight when all foes are melee, so that they zerg us as a group for easy DoT spread. </li>
   <li> Before Force Serenity, when target would not be near death after Serenity. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Ticks immediately and once per 3 seconds for 18 seconds, 7 ticks total. </li>
   <li> Deals internal (yellow) damage, which bypass many defences. </li>
   <li> Double Force cost of Sever Force but slightly less damage. </li>
   <li> Heals us 10% of the damage dealt (lv. 52+), very little even when spread. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-26"> Force in Balance </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Biggest and instant AoE. Spread Sever Force and Weaken Mind. </li>
   <li> Put counted debuff on victims that boost DoT damage and refund Force. </li>
   <li> Also put a debuff that increases AoE damage taken. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Spread Sever Force and/or Weaken Mind to every target if <i>any</i> target have them. </li>
   <li> Spread both DoTs if possible, but if the target is flimsy and will die before that, DoT(s) a different target or just fire Force in Balance as burst AoE (without any DoT). </li>
   <li> Use on cooldown.  Group, Single, Bursting, Kiting, just cast it on CD. </li>
   <li> Except when a close group of adds are expected soon, in which case reserve this for them. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Newly spread DoTs will have full duration, but existing DoTs won't be refreshed. </li>
   <li> Newly spread DoTs will immediately tick, adding to burst damage. </li>
   <li> Consumes multiple Force Potency when used on multiple targets.  Not optimal but acceptable. </li>
   <li> Heals us 20% of total damage dealt. (10% before lv. 52) </li>
   <li> Deals internal (yellow) damage, which bypass many defences. </li>
   <li> At level 68, Resonant Pulse has 50% proc on <i>each</i> target, damaging itself and <i>all</i> enemies in its 5 meters. </li>
   <li> The pulse will not hit Lift and other mez, but the main attack will. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-28"> Force Serenity </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Biggest burst attack, also our main self-heal. </li>
   <li> 30% more damage (and heal) against weakened target. </li>
   <li> Force cost -15 when used after Force in Balance. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Use on cooldown, after weaken mind and Force in Balance. </li>
   <li> Skip Force in Balance if it is on cooldown or on reserve. </li>
   <li> Telekinetic Throw instead if target is too weak to waste Weaken + Serenity. </li>
   <li> Best used of Force Potency because of high damage and heal. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Heal us 100% of damage dealt. (50% before lv. 52) Which generates normal heal threat. </li>
   <li> Deals internal (yellow) damage, which bypass many defences. </li>
   <li> Don't need to be used immediately after Force in Balance; the force cost discount depends on its counted DoT debuff, which takes at least 4 GCD to spent. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-2"> Force Quake </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Primary weapon of mass destruction against flimsy enemies. </li>
   <li> 33% chance to stun each standard and weak target per tick.  </li>
   <li> Zero cooldown and very big radius.  But slow start, unmovable, and high Force cost. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Stun and dispatch a big groups of flimsy or near-death opponents. </li>
   <li> Always use Force in Balance first: bursty, cheaper, and applies AoE debuff. </li>
   <li> Do not use on non-trivial foes; DoTs and focus fire them. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> 3 seconds channel, ticks once per second. </li>
   <li> Roughly equals to saber striking every target, at a high Force cost. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-0"> Disturbance </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Situational rotation filler. Primed by Telekinetic Throw like Vanquish. </li>
   <li> Low damage and take time to cast when unprimed, worse than Project. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When Disturbance is primed, and Vanquish is on cooldown longer than 3 seconds, and we can Telekinetic Throw in time to prime and Vanquish, and we have nothing else to do like self Bubble or self Rejuvenate. </li>
   <li> In all other cases, just Telekinetic Throw. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> At level 40, has 60% chance to trigger Rippling Force which immediately deals around ⅕ damage. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="jc-3"> Project </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> The initial ranged attack of Jedi Consular, still useful at high level. </li>
   <li> Moderate instant damage, quick cooldown, stuns standard and weak enemy 0.5s. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When we are running and want to attack, and other attacks are on cooldown. </li>
   <li> Quickly stun a standard or weak enemy to stop its movement, channel, or cast. </li>
   <li> To spend last Force Potency on, when Force in Balance and Force Serenity are both on cooldown. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Telekinetic Throw is often a better choice, even when kiting, because of Throw's buffs and zero CD. One primed Vanquish is worth 4 Projects. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="jc-2"> Saber Strike </h4>
<ul>
   <li> Our first and only melee attack, we have outgrown it as a DPS. </li>
   <li> For practical purpose, just forget Saber Strike ever exists. </li>
</ul >



<h3 id="controls"> Controls </h3>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Lift furthest foe(s), stun strongest, interrupt all interruptible boss. </li>
   <li> Control (mez, stun, and interrupts) is our responsibility as a DPS. </li>
   <li> Tanks are busy, healers lack accuracy. Control is our duty. </li>
   <li> We lack in interrupts, but have some of the best controls. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="jc-6"> Force Lift </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> The best soft crown control (mez) in game. </li>
   <li> Works on any controllable targets, including droids and turrets. </li>
   <li> Breaks on <i>any</i> damage, including DoT or passive proc damage. </li>
   <li> Very, very powerful with utilities. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Take tough target(s) out of action while dealing with its more fragile friends. </li>
   <li> Take fresh target(s) (before DoT) out of action for a break (self heal, cooldown etc.) </li>
   <li> Disturb (inc. interrupts) kiting target(s) without pushing it away or Force Wave is on cooldown. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li class="pvp"> Last 8 seconds in PvP. </li>
   <li> Starred NPCs (strong or above) recovers hp when lifted, but totally worth it. </li>
   <li> Kite the other enemies away (5 meter+) to avoid Resonant Pulse hitting the target(s). </li>
   <li> After we lift the furthest foe a few times, smart teammates will learn to expect it and leave them alone. </li>
   <li> All op bosses, most fp bosses, and many ch bosses are immune. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="jc-4"> Force Wave </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> On of the three pushes in game and arguably the best (when used correctly). </li>
   <li> Push all enemies in the 135° cone away from us, usually ahead, but adjacent ones may go backward or sideways. </li>
   <li> Thus, when positioned correctly, Force Wave can push both ways on bridges. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Push enemies down high cliffs and bridges. </li>
   <li> Push widespread enemies close together for easier AoE and DoT spread. </li>
   <li> Disturb multiple enemies, stopping their casts, channels, and movements. </li>
   <li> Do <i>not</i> do the last while in a team; it'd nullify teammates' attacks if the targets are pushed out of range. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Force Wave's push distance is the lowest of all three. </li>
   <li> Cone goes towards character facing, not camera facing. </li>
   <li> Pushing enemies to a wall is a easy way to line them up, but will result in a wide line if standing too close when push. </li>
   <li> On some PvE maps the NPCs won't die from the fall; wait for them to respawn and dispatch normally (don't push again). </li>
   <li> All op bosses, most fp bosses, and many ch bosses are immune. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="jc-5"> Force Stun </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> A hard stun that is not interrupted by damages. </li>
   <li> Use on the toughest enemy in a group, esp. when it casts or channels. </li>
   <li> Generally speaking, stun often and stun early in PvE. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> I usually stun after DoT spread on trash mobs, when I switch to single target focus fire. </li>
   <li> Also serves as an alternative interrupt, just with a long cooldown. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Watch teammate's stun.  Overlapped stuns is a waste. </li>
   <li> In a quick fight we usually don't need to stun. </li>
   <li> Companion in damage role has a ranged stun with lower cooldown. (At least they don't have mez.) </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="jc-10"> Mind Snap </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Our basic interrupt ability, stops the target's current cast or channel. </li>
   <li> Mind Snap is off-GCD: use it when we see a slow cast or channel and immediately resume next attack. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Use on big attacks of any interruptible champions and bosses.  The slower the deadlier. </li>
   <li> Also work great on trash mob healers (medics/repair bots).  </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Non-controllable enemies may still be interruptible. </li>
   <li> Force Lift, Force Stun, Force Wave, and Kinetic Collapse also work as interrupts on controllable enemies. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="jc-11"> Force Slow </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> There are few times when we want to slow a slowable enemy instead of using more efficient attacks. </li>
   <li> Such as Telekinetic Throw, which also slow (or pin) the target while doing higher damage and buffs us. </li>
   <li> Can be used on the move, unlike Telekinetic Throw. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When we kite a slowable enemy, usually champions. <span class="pvp">And pvp.</span> </li>
   <li> When we are running and other mobile attacks are on cooldown. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Damage is on par with Saber Strike, which is among our lowest. </li>
   <li> Overlaps with Confound to virtually pins the victim. </li>
</ul>


<h3> Heals and Defenses </h3>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Not our main job, unless there are kolto stations where we can stand by while we attack. </li>
   <li> Run away and hide behind cover (LoS) is a damage control skill that we must get into habit of, as a ranged DoT DPS. </li>
   <li> Force Mend is our main self heal and is free. Force Serenity is our 2<sup>nd</sup> biggest attack <i>and</i> self heal. Use them. </li>
   <li> Bubble is our most efficient "heal". Throw it out when a friend needs help. </li>
   <li> After combat, revive fallen mates and heal them.  We can revive in combat, but let healer do that. </li>
   <li> When necessary, don't forget Heroic Moment, Unity/Sacrifice (gets from Light/Dark V), Medpaks, and Shielding adrenal. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Since we are not healer, our heals generate full threat. </li>
   <li> Healing generate threat on every enemy, drawing their fire if no one else has threat, in which case Cloud Mind won't save us. </li>
   <li> Absorption is no longer bugged; multiple absorbs run on a first come first absorb rule. </li>
   <li> We can protect and heal friendly NPC under attacks, potentially trolling Imperials in PvE instance. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-15"> Force Barrier </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> The most powerful panic button in swtor. </li>
   <li> Purge and immune to <i>all</i> removable negative effects. </li>
   <li> Any movement or action will break the channelling. </li>
   <li> Our DoTs keeps ticking while we are safe from harm. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Use before we die, if there is hope left to win or flee. </li>
   <li> Can also be used as stun breaker, e.g. to save a friend. </li>
   <li> Break early when the danger has passed. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Can't stop instant death attacks and mechanics. </li>
   <li> Cooldown not shortened by alacrity, but a utility does. </li>
   <li> Post effect shield absorbs 15k per count (max 4) and last 5 seconds. </li>
   <li> The utility that adds healing can heal us up to 28% hp. </li>
   <li> (Test tick rate and alacrity) </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-5"> Force Armor (Bubble) </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Our best damage control, absorbs about 10% hp. </li>
   <li> More than all our heals except Force Mend. </li>
   <li> Can be placed on self and all friend(s). </li>
   <li> Comes with Force Imbanaced debuff which prevent re-bubble within 20 seconds. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Keep it on ourselves always, except: </li>
   <li> If a Seer Sage is on the team and likes to bubble us, let him/her do it. Theirs are stronger, have shorter lockout, and heal us on pop. </li>
   <li> If there is no Sage healer or if (s)he isn't bubbling, we can bubble teammate(s) before combat. </li>
   <li> Throw a bubble over when a teammate is taking a beating. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Bubble is not heal, and will not crit or be affected by healing bonus/penalties. </li>
   <li> When placed on teammate, absorbed damage is their threat, not our threat. </li>
   <li> Bubble utilities only apply to own bubble, and will be visually different. </li>
   <li> When we see these special bubble on an ally, do <i>not</i> bubble him/her. </li>
   <li> Alacrity does not affect bubble or lockout duration. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-8"> Force Mend </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Our biggest heal, free and off GCD, heals only ourselves. </li>
   <li> Heals slightly more than bubble right out of box. </li>
   <li> With utilities, heals around ¼ hp on crit. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Whenever hp is lower than ¾. </li>
   <li> Force Mend is off GCD, we can use it between other actions without slowing down. </li>
   <li> Often used with Force Potency to make sure it crit. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Cooldown not shortened by alacrity, but a utility exists. </li>
   <li> Generate a big, instant threat. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-4"> Rejuvenate </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Our basic heal, low cooldown and cost efficient. </li>
   <li> Heals about 5% over 9s, slightly above half a bubble. </li>
   <li> Our only instant heal that can be used on friends. </li>
   <li> We enjoy 10% defense bonus when rejuvenating, around 5% damage reduction. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When attack can't be made and bubble is not an option, such as kiting. </li>
   <li> Pre-combat defence buff. Note that this will aggro all NPCs when we are hurt, get healed, and thus create threats. </li>
   <li> Keep it (and bubble, and Force Mend) up in a long fight to mitigate damage. </li>
   <li> Post-combat recovery. Use before Meditation. </li>
   <li> To "ping" or "touch" a friend out of combat. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Tick once per 3 seconds, three ticks total after upfront heal. </li>
   <li> May be used on CD. Do 30% more heals on cooldown than end-to-end. </li>
   <li> Upfront heal will consume Force Potency which is very wasteful. The HoT ticks do not. </li>
   <li> Rejuvenate heals very little but gives a lasting off-heal impression because of HoT. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-3"> Benevolence </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Our "burst" heal, can be spammed but can't move and pretty expensive. </li>
   <li> Roughly double the initial heal of Rejuvenate, but still less than bubble. </li>
   <li> No pushback mitigation, don't use when under fire. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When there is a <i>very</i> urgent need of us to heal, like when we just need to buy two seconds for a tank. </li>
   <li> When there is <i>absolutely</i> nothing else to do, almost never in combat. </li>
   <li> Post-combat patch up of friends after revive and Rejuvenate. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Our biggest repeatable Force burner. </li>
   <li> Do pityful heal even when we spam it, far less than our own dps for example. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-12"> Cloud Mind </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Threat dump. Lower our threat and hopefully divert NPC's attention to our teammates. </li>
   <li> Useful even when solo. Let our companion share the burden! </li>
   <li class="pvp"> Threat does not exist in PvP, no need to dump threat. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Should be used as part of rotation, <i>before</i> we draw many fires. Make it a habit. </li>
   <li> When there is a tank nearby, give the tank a chance to take back control before dumping threat. </li>
   <li> Use after big hitters and heals for best result. </li>
   <li> Only useful when there is a teammate or companion to take the heat. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Learn <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/53iske/guide_threat_and_guard_explaining_the_game/">how threat works</a>. </li>
   <li> There is a utility that make it serves as a DCD. </li>
   <li> Resist the habit when we are kiting a boss away, e.g. Dread Master Raptus in Dread Palace's final fight. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-10"> Restoration </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Our main cleanse, removes up to two debuffs from self or friend. </li>
   <li> Can cleanse all force-based debuffs and some non-force debuffs. </li>
   <li> Which non-force debuffs are cleansable is more or less unpredictable.  Ask EAware to fix. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When the healer is not cleansing or need a hand (too many to cleanse or too busy healing). </li>
   <li> When we are on our own and need a cleanse, obviously. </li>
   <li> When a cleanse is very deadly and worth throwing cleanses to removed faster, e.g. Athiss final boss. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Don't bother to cleanse if the debuff is minor, like small burns or common armor reduce. </li>
   <li> Try if you are unsure anyway.  The pin in Rakata mm fp is debuffable, for example. </li>
   <li> Force Speed can purge all movement debuffs by picking the Egress utility. </li>
   <li> Force Barrier can purge all debuffs. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="jc-8"> Force of Will </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Our basic stun breaker. Way too long cooldown. </li>
   <li> Removes all slows, pins, and stunning debuffs from ourself. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When we need to break out of stun. </li>
   <li> I normally reserve it for "break or die" situations, because the cooldown is so long. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Don't bother to break if the stun is minor, like slows, push, or short stuns. </li>
   <li> Many PvE pins and stuns are avoidable or interruptible. </li>
   <li> Force Barrier, on an even longer cooldown, also serves as a stun breaker. </li>
   <li> Stun breakers are off-GCD:  act immediately on break. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-14"> Revival </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> In-combat revive, limited to Sage, Scoundrel, and Commando. </li>
   <li> Can revive fallen teammate or companion (own or teammate's). </li>
   <li> Prevent the whole team from in-combat revival for 5 mins. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When the healer falls, we should pull him/her up as soon as feasible. </li>
   <li> When someone else falls, and the healer is (very) busy, we may <i>consider</i> doing it. </li>
   <li> When in doubt, leave it to the healer(s), who may reserve it for more important teammates.
        Which may be us. Don't rob ourselves of our revive chance! </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Our out of combat revive has no cooldown, and we should help revive after combat. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="jc-1"> Meditation </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Out of combat Health/Force recovery. </li>
   <li> Rejuvenate before rest to speed up hp recovery. </li>
   <li> Heal wounded friends when we don't need to rest. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Try to rest as few and as short as possible when in a group. </li>
   <li> Buy Bantha Steak from cantina vendors to boost out of combat hp regen. </li>
</ul>



<h3 id="buff">Mobility, Buffs, and Others </h3>

<ul class="key">
   <li> We have high mobility, a unique friend pull, and a powerful raid buff. </li>
   <li> Combined with heals, bubble, push, lift etc., we are really good at supporting our team. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="jc-9"> Force Speed </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Our mobile ability to chase enemy, kite, or flee. </li>
   <li> Arguably our most important survival power. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Whenever we need a boost of speed to be in the right place at the right time. </li>
   <li> Offensive example: Dash up to enemies and push them off the bridge or platform, before they run up to us. </li>
   <li> Defensive example: Dash behind cover after applying DoTs.  Run outside of the range/area of a casted/channeled power.</li>
   <li> Non-combat example: Make it easier to jump past some gaps. (e.g. The False Emperor) </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Egress can removes all slow &amp; immobilizing effects, must take in some fights<span class="pvp"> and PvP</span>. </li>
   <li> Force Speed is off-GCD, so don't pause the action. Do something while we run. It's cool! </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-17"> Phase Walk </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> First use: Set mark at current position (0.5 casted). Second use: Teleport back to mark. </li>
   <li> Right click phase walk buff to remove placed mark. </li>
   <li> Ignores line of sight and all obstacles; only limit is range. (60 meters) </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Teleport to behind cover, make the enemies chase us with DoTs burning. </li>
   <li> Mark and teleport to an important location in a boss fight (kolto station, console etc.). </li>
   <li> Mark a solid ground before/when fighting a pushy boss, as a safety net. </li>
   <li> When collecting datacron, place a mark before jump and teleport back if the jump failed. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Placing mark has no cooldown. Teleport cooldown not shortened by alacrity, but a utility does. </li>
   <li> Not usable when hindered; trying to used it while hindered (ability greyed out) will cancel placed mark. </li>
   <li> Mark is fixed in space and won't move with the terrain it is placed on, e.g. elevators or Tatooine Jawa balloon. </li>
   <li> Except where the whole map is moving, e.g. Dark Design Heroic or Umbara flashpoint. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-13"> Rescue </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> The no.1 trolling ability in swtor. </li>
   <li> Pulls a teammate to our location and lower his/her threat instantly. </li>
   <li> Requires line of sight, but not consent. Subject can be immobilised. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Pull companion or teammate from a dangerous or stuck position, e.g. rocket launch of Cademimu. </li>
   <li> Pull a teammate to an advantageous spot, such as shortcut, safe attack spot, or the cover where everyone else is doing LoS with. </li>
   <li> Pull a teammate who's pushed/pulled far away or to a tough spot, e.g. from a ledge or a different floor. </li>
   <li> Pull a near death teammate away from the heat of battle, hopefully causing target swap due to threat dump. </li>
   <li> Troll a teammate by pulling him/her into pit, cliff, fire, or other exciting terrains. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Can be used on friendly non-teammate but only reduce threat, not pull. </li>
   <li> Can pull a falling friend in theory.  Never see it happens in real combat. Always too slow. </li>
   <li> Don't pull the tank unless (s)he is really stuck.  Pulling will lower his/her threat resulting in lost control. </li>
   <li> Don't pull if it is not obviously advantageous. It disrupts the subject's action, esp. melee classes. </li>
   <li> Like all abilities, does not work on fallen comrades. A pity. </li>
   <li> The only other ability that modifiy friend location is Vanguard's transpose. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="jc-7"> Force Potency </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> First of our two basic buffs, grant next two direct hits or heals +60% crit chance. </li>
   <li> Yields big number when used with 1) Force Mend, 2) Force Serenity on weakened victim. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When we need that critical Force Mend, immediately. </li>
   <li> Before we put Force in Balance and Force Serenity on a tough single target. </li>
   <li> Best used during Mental Alacrity because of reduced cooldown. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> This power is why we should get 40% crit right after 110% accuracy.  It turns Force Potency into 100% crit, or super crit, where overflowed crit chance turns into bonus heal/damage. </li>
   <li> Don't waste it on Force Quake, Force Wave, Rejuvenate, Stun, and other small but direct heals/attacks. </li>
   <li> All other DPS disciplines has auto crit (guaranteed crit).  We don't; this is our only "auto-crit". </li>
   <li> The 6-set bonus adds 1 more charge for a total of 3. If we don't use Force Potency on CD, the set bonus is wasted! </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-11"> Mental Alacrity </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Second of our two basic buffs, boost action speed and hasten DoTs applied in buff duration. </li>
   <li> Faster cast/channel and quicker ability cooldowns when used in the buff duration. </li>
   <li> Also increase Force regen, but too little to make a difference. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Speed up rotation and rotation cycle to increase dps. </li>
   <li> When things go south and we need to kill adds fast or bubble everyone fast. </li>
   <li> When impatient.  The cooldown is short enough to be used every combat or two, and multiple times in longer boss fights. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Hastened DoTs won't slow down after buff expires. </li>
   <li> Best used on a fresh rotation so that the cooldowns aligns. </li>
   <li> Best used with Force Empowerment. </li>
</ul>


<h4 data-sprite="sage-16"> Force Empowerment </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Raid buff.  One of the best in game. </li>
   <li> Apply to the whole team, and prevent further Force Empowerment for 5 mins. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> For bosses that have burn phase, use at burn phase. </li>
   <li> Otherwise, use early in a boss fight. </li>
   <li> When in doubt, use when boss is near death (10% hp or so), or when someone use their raid buff. </li>
   <li> Not used in non-boss fights, except when the party may be overwhelmed. Like when fighting multiple pods. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Cooldown not shortened by alacrity. </li>
   <li> Only healie classes and sentinels has raid buffs, 4 total. </li>
   <li> Force Empowerment is the only one that is free and can be used anytime. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="jc-0"> Force Valor </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Our class buff. Have it on all teammates always. </li>
   <li> <b>Mandatory</b>: Finish chapter 2 of all base class pairs to get all 4 class buffs in one cast. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When we, our companion, or any teammate do not have the class buffs. </li>
   <li> Such as right after revive, whether in combat or out of combat. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> One of the few abilities that grant internal/elemental resistance. </li>
   <li> With Trooper/Bounty Hunter class buff, reapplying class buffs would cause a small drop in hp cap, so don't do it unnecessary. </li>
   <li> The mastery/endurance bonus have no effect on most planets because of level sync, but will be effective in flashpoints, uprisings, and operations. </li>
   <li class="pvp"> In a cross faction pvp we may get the Imperial buff set instead. Leave them be. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-9"> Vindicate </h4>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Spend a GCD to sacrifice force regen for instant force. </li>
   <li> Telekinetic Throw is almost always a better choice. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Don't use this power. Forget it exists. </li>
   <li> If often run out of force, revise rotation habit; Balance Sages depends on synergies to save Force. </li>
   <li> Ok, may be when we are hiding and have no one to attack. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Each use has a net gain of 20 Force, but we are wasting that GCD. </li>
   <li> A full Telekinetic Throw regens 28+ Force (36+ with 4-set bonus), while dealing damage and priming Vanquish/Disturbance. </li>
   <li> Vindicate is the main Force regen ability of Seers. When we respec we need it on the bar and easy to click. </li>
</ul>


<h2> Utilities </h2>

<ul class="key">
   <li> We get first utilities at level 14, then every 8 levels for 8 total. New rank open with every two picks. </li>
   <li> Can reset and repick anytime out of combat. </li>
   <li> Don't be afraid to ask the team for time to change utils before boss fights. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> It is ok to trade high rank picks for low rank utilities. </li>
   <li> All bubble effects apply only to our own bubble on ourselves. Reconsider if a Seer aggressively bubble us (cought). </li>
   <li> Like combat style, utilities is personal. Experiment and build your own preference. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Skillful </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> First at level 14, second at level 22. </li>
   <li> <b class="good">Recommended</b>: Pain Bearer (+5% heal taken) </li>
   <li> <b class="good">Good</b>: Jedi Resistance (3% damage reduction) </li>
   <li> <b class="maybe">Situational</b>: Tectonic Master (+25% Force Quake damage), Dizzying Force (Lift +2 unstarred victims) </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-0"> Psychic Suffusion </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="bad">Avoid</b>.
        Force Wave is not a power that we should use frequently. </li>
   <li> Too little heal to worth even a Skillful slot. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-1"> Jedi Resistance </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="good">Good</b>.
        Not big, but better than most alternatives. </li>
   <li> Can and did save lives. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-2"> Tectonic Master </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="maybe">Situational</b>.
        Perfect for clearing trash mobs. </li>
   <li> A must for uprisings. </li>
   <li> Upgraded Force Quake is still far inferior to Force in Balance. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-3"> Pain Bearer </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="nice">Recommended</b>.
        Almost as good as 5% damage reduction. </li>
   <li> Does not apply to drained life (e.g. Force Serenity). </li>
   <li> Apply to Rejuvenate, Force Mend, Life Ward (bubble heal) etc. Pick it always. Period. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-4"> Dizzying Force </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="maybe">Situational</b>.
        Taking 3 enemies out in one go is amazing, but obviously not useful when all NPCs are starred. </li>
   <li> The main target can and should still be starred. </li>
   <li> The lift is not shared; take them one by one at our leisure. </li>
   <li> Enemies who are immune to lift are also immune to the accuracy debuff. (Need testing) </li>
   <li> Best picked with Containment which make Force Lift instant. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-5"> Benevolent Haste </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="bad">Avoid</b>.
        May be nice if Benevolence is useful in combat. </li>
</ul >


<h3> Masterful </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> First at level 30, second at level 38. </li>
   <li> <b class="good">Recommended</b>: Valiance (+30% Force Mend) </li>
   <li> <b class="good">Good</b>: Telekinetic Defense (Bubble counterattack), Staggering Stratagem (Force Stun upgrade) </li>
   <li> <b class="maybe">Situational</b>: Mind Ward (15% DoT reduction) </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-6"> Blockout </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="bad">Very Situational</b>.
        Long CD, moderate mitigation, short duration. </li>
   <li> I pick it when I <i>really</i> need every DCD I can get. Which is surprisingly often. Your mileage may vary. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-7"> Mind Ward </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="maybe">Situational</b>.
        Some boss fight has periodic damage that hurts. This helps mitigate them. </li>
   <li> Obviously not useful on light or zero DoTs. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-8"> Valiance </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="good">Recommended</b>.
        Multiply with Pain Bearer, Valorous Spirit, and a high crit! </li>
   <li> The Rescue damage reduction is nice but no one pick this or use Rescue for it. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-9"> Confound </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="bad">Very Situational</b>.
        Not that many foes that can be slowed need to be kite. </li>
   <li> Weaken Mind does last long and is spreadable. </li>
   <li> Best used solo to slow and/or LoS a group of melee trash. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-10"> Telekinetic Defense </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="good">Good</b>.
        Decent choice for when we don't know what to pick, since it guarantees some passive dps. </li>
   <li> Think an extra Disturbance every second, which is pretty good. </li>
   <li> Suitable for soloing low-power conflict where we are always under attack <i>and</i> bubble can last a while. </li>
   <li> The counter attacks can crit like normal attacks. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-11"> Staggering Stratagem </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="maybe">Situational/By Preference</b>.
        Lower stun CD and damage debuff is nice when fighting champions. </li>
   <li> I like it because I can stun more often. </li>
</ul >



<h3> Heroic </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> First at level 46, second at level 54. </li>
   <li> <b class="good">Recommended</b>: Mental Defense (+30% stunned &amp; AoE damage reduction) </li>
   <li> <b class="good">Good</b>: Kinetic Collapse (Bubble blinds on pop) </li>
   <li> <b class="maybe">Situational</b>: Containment (instant Force Lift), Egress (Force Speed purge movement debuffs) </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-12"> Egress </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="maybe">Situational</b>.
        Very useful in boss fights that slows or pins us. </li>
   <li> Does not limit debuff type or number, unlike Restoration. </li>
   <li> Can be used with Metaphysical Alacrity for shorter Force Speed CD. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-13"> Mental Defense </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="good">Recommended</b>.
        Most classes has either reduction as passive. We have neither. </li>
   <li> Boss stuns and AoEs are often deadly. When in doubt, take it. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-14"> Metaphysical Alacrity </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="maybe">Situational/By Preference</b>.
        I often pick this because I have high ping and need Force Speed to get out of circles. </li>
   <li> Feels good in solo <span class="pvp">and PvP </span>where we can run without waiting for others. </li>
   <li> Make Force Barrier CD slightly more reasonable. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-15"> Kinetic Collapse </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="good">Good/By Preference</b>.
        Give us a free and frequent passive crowd control. </li>
   <li> Blind is like stun. Blinded characters stops what they are doing and can't act while blinded. </li>
   <li> Not triggered when refreshing bubble before it pops, but triggered by manual removal of bubble buff. </li>
   <li> Radius is 5 meters. We must stay close to enemies to blind them, which runs counter to our usual stay back style. </li>
   <li class="pvp"> In PvP it can unintentionally fills up opponent's resolve. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-16"> Containment </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="maybe">By Preference</b>.
        Essentially gives us two interrupts and/or stuns. </li>
   <li> Also make our Force Lift usable on the go and immune from pushback, which is when we need Force Lift most. </li>
   <li> Useful on adds in boss fights where they are spread wide and far. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-17"> Force Wake </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="bad">Avoid</b>.
        Force Wave is not something we use often even when solo. </li>
   <li> <i>Maybe</i> useful when we want to push and flee, such as on a planet. </li>
   <li> Given the options we have at this point, there are few reasons to pick this. </li>
</ul >



<h3> Legendary </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> First at level 62, second at level 70. </li>
   <li> <b class="good">Recommended</b>: Valorous Spirit (Force Mend upgrade) </li>
   <li> <b class="good">Good</b>: Force Mobility (Force Serenity on move), Life Ward (Bubble regen) </li>
   <li> <b class="maybe">Situational</b>: Ethereal Entity (Phase Walk upgrade) </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-18"> Force Mobility </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="good">Good/By Preference</b>.
        Some players consider this mandatory. I say not in PvE. </li>
   <li> Main problem: does not make Force Serenity immune to pushbacks, interrupts, or support peek and fire. </li>
   <li> That said, better mobility is still good. Try and decide yourself. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-19"> Swift Rejuvenation </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="bad">Very situational</b>.
        Pick this to "prime" Force Serenity, Force Lift, or (if necessary) Vanquish before combat or behind cover. </li>
   <li> Wasteful because of extra GCD, even when it can <i>somewhat</i> replace Force Mobility and Containment. </li>
   <li> More useful as part of a team, where we let other go first and do our control and rotations later. </li>
   <li> Do not pick just because we may cleanse. Most lower rank utilities are better options. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-20"> Life Ward </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="good">Good default</b>.
        Think a Rejuvenate tick every second.</li>
   <li> Best for between-combat recovery and in downtime rich boss fights, and helps when LoS or kiting. </li>
   <li> Also let us Force Barrier at very low hp and come out in a better shape. </li>
   <li> Bubble right before or right after Force Barrier for even more heal. </li>
   <li> Remember, actual heals generate a tiny threat to every NPC! </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-21"> Valorous Spirit </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="good">Recommended</b>.
        More Force Mend and free damage reduction when we need it? Yes please. </li>
</ul >

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-22"> Ethereal Entity </h4>
<ul>
   <li> <b class="maybe">Situational</b>.
        Turns Phase Walk into a DCD that we can use on par with Cloud Mind. </li>
   <li> Helps when kiting melee bosses who jump over as soon as (s)he gets LoS. </li>
   <li> Also useful when using Phase Walk a lot, like retrying jumps. </li>

<h2 id="tips"> Leveling and Gearing </h2>

<h3 id="leveling"> Leveling </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Low levels: Use Force Quake and Force in Balance to dispatch minions, then Telekinetic Throw/Project remaining foe(s). Use Lift/Stun to pause tough NPCs. </li>
   <li> Mid levels: With instant Mind Crust at lv 24 and DoT spread at lv 28, we can meaningfully contribute in veteran flashpoints, a good way to learn and level up. </li>
   <li> Level 42+: With Force Serenity, we may use the Very Simple Rotation, but take away the final Telekinetic Throw. </li>
   <li> Level 56+: Telekinetic Throw now ticks fast so can add the droped Throw back into rotation. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Free to play is limited to level 50.  Subscribe once to have access to current level cap forever.  Amazon and Origin sell cheaper packs than official site. </li>
   <li> When a new expansion lands, again just subscribe once to raise to new level cap. </li>
   <li> Many veterans stop playing much class story after getting starship (or even before that); Heroics and Flashpoints levels up quicker. </li>
   <li> Most world bosses do not require high level to hunt. If a group is forming on the planet you are on, join the fun! </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="gearing"> Gearing </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Typhon (Prologue): Don't buy any gear. Just do class quest and equip the best loots. </li>
   <li> Fleet: Go to left hand side of Supplies section and buy a set of moddable (orangw) gear. </li>
   <li> PvE stats: 110% accuracy, then Crit &gt; Power &gt; Mastery &gt; Endurance. Leave alacrity until endgame. </li>
   <li> Modifications: Versatile hilt/armoring, Lethal Mod (unlettered), Initiative Enhancements. No augments until end game. </li>
   <li> Upgrade main hand hilt, off hand armoring, chest armoring, and legs armoring at level X. They have biggest impact on attack and defence. </li>
   <li> Upgrade the rest whenever you like. I upgrade every two steps (8 to 10 levels). </li>
   <li> Optionally, run veteran flashpoints to get purple gears at current level, requires subscription or artifact authorisation. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Same relic effects don't stack; don't use two relic that proc the same stat.  I prefer proc relic over clicky relic; we have enough to click already. </li>
   <li> 110% accuracy is required to always hit NPCs, to ensures instant Vanquish from a complete Telekinetic Throw.<span class="pvp"> 105% in pvp for the same.</span> </li>
   <li> Not missing is also very important when you need that stun, mez, interrupt, or push to lands. </li>
   <li> Dump the rest into crit.  We don't have enough stat budget to get enough crit and make alacrity useful. </li>
   <li> Alacrity has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/7n6eu0/some_alacrity_numbers/">stepped impact</a> on GCD: 0% = 1.5s, 7.15% = 1.4s, 15.4% = 1.3s. Aim for these magic numbers, don't go below or between. </li>
   <li> Skip defensive stats (defense, shielding, absorption). We don't have the abilities to make good use of them. </li>
   <li> High endurance is not worth the mastery and power we lost. Always pick power and mastery over endurance, but after critical and alacrity. </li><!-- Plot a chart to find 5.7 falloff point -->
</ul>

<h3 id="gearing_endgame"> Endgame Gearing </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> At level 70, we earn cxp to rank up Galatic Command, split into 4 tiers. </li>
   <li> Each rank gives a command crate. Open crates to get corresponding end game gear with set bonus. Put augmentations on gold gears. </li>
   <li> Power &amp; mastery proc relics (Serendipitous Assault &amp; Focused Retribution) are considered best since critical relic hits diminishing return. </li>
   <li> At full 14x ir248 gear with 228 to 236 augments, we have 3654 to 3682 stat budget for Accuracy, Critical, and Alacrity, plus 214 Critical from Relics and Crystals, plus 339 with accuracy/critical stim. </li>
   <li> 737 Accuracy gives us 110% after companion bonus (see notes). 2x Initiative Enhancement/Package/Device and 3x Accuracy Augment gives us 750 to 756. </li>
   <li> Alacrity should be 703 or 1860, but 1860 leaves too little for Critical. 1x Quick Savant E/P/D and 5x Alacrity Augment gives us 711 to 721, next best is same with Accuracy. </li>
   <li> I haven't had time to test it, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/7upvqu/calculations_for_the_point_of_diminishing_returns/">some says</a> Critical's diminishing return means we should spare 2 to 4 augments for Mastery or Power. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="Galatic Command">
   <li> Opening command crates at top of tier 1 to 3 (close to but before rank 80, 190, and 299) will give better drop rate. </li>
   <li> Each crate grants Command Tokens (CT), legacy wide and can be used to purchase Tier 1 (ir230) equipments on the fleet's Tier 1 equipment vendor. </li>
   <li> Disintegrate unwanted gear to get unassembled components (UC). PvP and GSF are the main UC sources. </li>
   <li> We can turn ir230, ir236, and ir242 gears into unassembled pieces with many UC. i.e. Take an ir230 chest plus UC to get Tier 2 unassembled chest. </li>
   <li> We also get unassembled pieces from operations.  Take the pieces to Tier 2-4 vendor to turn them into gear. i.e. Tier 2 unassembled chest can be turned into any ir236 chest. </li>
   <li> Only ir230, ir236, and ir242 gears can be upgraded.  Keep them as an option, as drop rate of <i>useful</i> ir248 is very low. </li>
   <li> When getting a gold armor/saber/focus that we already have, check whether its mod and enhancement can upgrade other gears. </li>
   <li> Focus's armoring can be placed on other armors, but that armor <i>will</i> lost its set bonus. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> It is strongly advised to unlock all four class buffs and all five companion bonus first. </li>
   <li> If we learn Biochem and train it to 600, we can craft (or buy) and use reusable consumables. </li>
   <li> Aim for 110% accuracy, 40% crit, and 7.15% alacrity first. Optimal arrangement takes some effort to meet. </li>
   <li> Accuracy/crit stim is a easy way to fill the stat budget, but may moves to mastery/power stim (Versatile Stim) once fully geared. </li>
   <li> Set bonus - 2-set: Force Serenity gives +2% buff to damage; 4-set: Increase Telekinetic Throw's Force regen, reduce Mental Alacrity CD; 6-set: Add 1 charge to Force Potency. </li>
   <li> Set bonus does not affect rotation, except perhaps when to use Force Potency. </li>
   <li> Seer (healer) has a different set with important bonus. For switching, wear 6 of our set and 1 healer set, then we only need to carry 5 healer gear to switch over. </li>
   <li class="pvp"> PvP needs only 105% accuracy; I switch earpiece out for Alacrity, part of my healer gear. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Combat"> Combat </h2>

<h3 id="companion"> Companion </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Companion can be set to any role, which decides their abilities. For most fights, DPS role (same as us) make most combats fast and safe. </li>
   <li> Companion abilities can be excluded from auto-cast by right clicking the ability. The green box will go dark. </li>
   <li> When we disable non-attack abilities, they do more basic attacks and thus higher dps. </li>
   <li> DPS can stun, heal can cleanse, tank can pull; may disable these to increase dps and let us control when to use them and on whom. </li>
   <li> Use passive mode and Rescue to move companion out of AoE in boss fights. </li>
   <li> Use Heroic Effort to heal in hard fights, and Unity/Sacrifice if we have it. </li>
   <li> Fallen companions, self or of a teammate, can be revived in-combat like a PC. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> A companion with high influence rank fights pretty well. In heroics, flashpoints, and uprisings it is common to fill the team with high rank companions. </li>
   <li> Gift influence decrease as companion rank goes up. Dialogue and crew mission influence do not. It's preferable to fill first 15 to 20 levels with gifts first. </li>
   <li> Buy the companion gift bonus perks and lots of cheap $200 gifts ($250 for non-subs) from the fleet's trade section. Shift+Click to buy in batch. </li>
   <li> See <a href="https://torcommunity.com/guides/companions#influence-love">gift</a> <a href="http://dulfy.net/2015/10/21/swtor-fallen-empire-companion-influences-guide/#Companion_Gifts">guides</a> for which type to buy and how many. </li>
   <li> Get in and out of vehicle or rocket boost to fully recover companion hp out of combat. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tactic"> Tactics </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Never go first; we are ranged not melee. Always let companion or teammate attack first. Exceptions: pure Sage group or companion dies too fast. </li>
   <li> Combat Priority: mechanics / survival &gt; adds &gt; teammate rescue / control &gt; spending our main attacks &gt; self-heal &gt; rotation fillers</li>
   <li> Bubble and Rejuvenate self before fight starts. Optionally place a Phase Walk. Keep bubble up during the fight. </li>
   <li> When under fire, run behind cover to force the enemies to run around it for easy AoE. This is called LoS. </li>
   <li> Stock up on med packs. Cheaper than dying. Use stim at (close to) max level. Use adrenal in tough fights. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="solo">
   <li> Start fight by lifting the furthest or strongest enemy. LoS the rest, spread DoT, Quake the weaks and normals, focus fire the rest one by one. Interrupt and stun champions. </li>
   <li> Spread <a href="#dot">Damage over Time</a> and <a href="kiting">Kite</a> the enemies. </li>
   <li> Force Wave can be used more or less liberally, but try to group the enemies for AoE. </li>
   <li> Buy and eat Peppered Bantha Steak and Chilled Corellian Cocktail to increase hp regen and companion effectiveness. Check the fleet's Cantina Vendor. </li>
   <li> When we finish a fight with Telekinetic Throw, use the primed Vanquish to start next fight before it expire! </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="team">
   <li> Move last or second last (around/before healer).  Find and stay near cover before and during combat. </li>
   <li> The more we lift, the more our teammates are aware that we'll lift. </li>
   <li> Restrain on use of Force Wave and Rescue. They both change positioning, which is disruptive. </li>
   <li> Use Cloud Mind often, even when we are not under attack, to keep our threat low. </li>
</ul>


<h3 id="dot"> Damage over Time (DoT) </h3>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Our DoTs are heavy, often but not always our main damage output. </li>
   <li> Spread Weaken Mind and Sever Force to multiple foes to <i>multiply</i> our dps. </li>
   <li> Usually spread by Force in Balance, but put them on one by one when can't. </li>
   <li> After spreading DoT, use focus fire to take down enemy fast, i.e. Force in Balance and Force Serenity. </li>
   <li> When enemies are very weak or near death, just Quake, Throw, or Project. </li>
   <li> Enemies who hasn't been attacked by others will turn to us when we DoT them.  Be ready to LoS or endure their fire. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Spreadable DoTs deals ¼ to ⅕ dps of focus fire dps on <i>each</i> target. The more the targets the higher the total dps. </li>
   <li> Use LoS, push, or run into enemy pod to huddle up the enemies for easy spread. </li>
   <li> If you don't spread, don't play Balance; play Telekinetic instead. </li>
   <li> Our DoTs deals more damage on near death victims (hp &lt;= 30%), but should be placed early when they're healthier. </li>
   <li> Each damage is a "tick". Vanquish ticks faster, the others slower. </li>
   <li> High alacrity make DoTs ticks faster in a shorter duration, determined when placed. </li>
   <li> DoT ticks are indirect damage - no Force Potency but trigger and enjoy proc relic individually. </li>
   <li> Think our DoT feedback heals as relic proc chance instead of heals; they heal so little. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="kiting"> Kiting </h3>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Kiting is making opponent(s) run after us, always chasing but rarely or never catch us, like a kite. </li>
   <li> While they are chasing us, our DoTs and/or friends are hurting them. </li>
   <li> Very low dps; kiting is a slow war of attrition used when we would otherwise die too fast to see it through. </li>
   <li> Sage DPSs can't facetank and depends on kiting to survive hard fights. </li>
   <li> Run sideways when kiting, don't run forward or backward. This let us throws DoTs and other  attacks, but not run slow like backsteping. </li>
   <li> Keep the action up even when moving.  DoTs, Project, Force in Balance, Slow, Stun, Bubble, Rejuvenate. Revise utility to get even more. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Kiting is about damage control, about lowering dtps to a winnable level. </li>
   <li> If the foe is not immune, Force Stun, Force Lift, and Kinetic Collapse should be used with and preferred over kiting as damage control. </li>
   <li> Mainly for solo<span class="pvp"> and PvP</span>. In team PvE, let tankies go tank. </li>
   <li> Also applies when a boss is chasing us, because everyone else is down or mechanic reason. </li>
   <li> Kiting is not about not taking any damage.  We may take more damage than we deal.  As long as we can overcome the damage we take and our enemy can't, it is working. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="kite_common"> General Kitings </h4>
<ul summary="Melee Kiting">
   <li> Run in circle around a cover, throw AoE before our kite clears the corners, deal DoTs and instant attacks when it poke out, then flee behind cover and self heal. Rinse and repeat. </li>
   <li> Melee enemies often move faster than us and can jump to us, called a gap close. </li>
   <li> After being jumped, Force Speed to another cover to put some distance, and use the chance to Force Serenity or Telekinetic Throw. </li>
   <li> Use Force Slow, Confound, and other crowd controls if the foe is not immune. </li>
   <li> Ethereal Entity is our only way to be immune from gap close, and can buy us valuable time to pepper the enemy with casted and channeled attacks. </li>
   <li> Either set companion to heal so that (s)he doesn't draw the enemy away, or let him/her die and kite alone. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="Ranged Kiting">
   <li> Common form is same as kiting melee, except ranged foes don't have gap closer but often have AoE. </li>
   <li> Some ranged NPCs have casted attack; immediately run behind cover so that it fails, then poke out and attack. </li>
   <li> Some encounters do not give us any place to hide. In this case kite at 30m range - get in range, deal DoTs, then flee and let the foe chase us. </li>
   <li> The 30m kiting also works on melees without gap closers. </li>
   <li> Preferably we run in a big circle on the map. When we can't, Force Speed from one end of the map to another like a pendulum. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="kite_special"> Special Kitings </h4>
<ul summary="LoS Kiting">
   <li> A special form of kiting when there is a big steam of trashes or adds that keep coming and coming. </li>
   <li> They always land at where the encounter is supposed to happen.  First step is to trigger the encounter, then run back far and behind a cover. </li>
   <li> The NPCs will come chase us.  This takes time, time for us to take the wave down, heal up, and cooldown for next wave. </li>
   <li> Use passive mode to stop  companion from chasing them. Ranged companions preferred. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="Facetank Kiting">
   <li> Sometimes nothing else works.  For me this is KotFE Chapter VIII's platform fight with the Zakuul captain, on master mode, where she jumps and beat me in two to three hits. </li>
   <li> We must still kite. Apply DoTs, run, DCDs right before she catches up, facetank a few seconds, Phase Walk and self heal, refresh DoT when she comes again and Force Barrier. </li>
   <li> DCDs: Unity (50% 15s), Advanced Polybiotic Shielding Adrenal (30% 15s), Blockout (30% 6s), Ethereal Entity (30% ?s), Valorous Spirit (15% 6s), Rejuvenate (5% 9s). </li>
   <li> Note that Blockout may direct the enemy's attention to our companion, instead of serving as a DCD! </li>
   <li> Also useful: Heroic Moment, Life Ward, Swift Rejuvenation. Medkits and stims assumed. </li>
</ul>


<h3 id="interface"> Interface and keybinds </h3>

<p>
Some tips for setting up swtor interface for best Balance Sage experience.
</p>

<h4 id="gui"> Interface </h4>
<ul>
   <li> Go preferred or subscription.  Preferred get four ability bars (sub six), enough for all class abilities plus a few more.
   You don't need to <i>hotkey</i> all abilities, but no class abilities are useless (except Saber Strike). </li>
   <li> Use team interface for non-op teams.  They show companion which may need our supports too. </li>
   <li> Enable "Highlight own effects" in target debuff bar, and scale it up.
   It let us see whether <i>our</i> DoTs and debuffs are on the target. </li>
   <li> Do the same to own and friends' debuff bars.
   With big debuff icons we can identify bubble/revive/raid-buff timer and cleansable debuffs. </li>
   <li> Enable Focus Target and do the same. Use it to monitor our DoT on the boss and its actions. </li>
   <li> I sort all buffs and debuffs - own, friends, foes - by total duration, so that the same effect always go to the same place. </li>
   <li> Scale up target and focus target cast bars until you can easily see the action text.
   Target yourself and Medidate to see the bar in interface editor.</li>
   <li> Global scaling is independent from component scales, and should be set before fine tuning individual blocks. </li>
</ul >

<h4 id="keybind"> Keybindings </h4>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Move forward and strafe with keyboard, turn with mouse drag, attack with hotkeys, select target with mouse or hotkey. </li>
   <li> Life savers like Mind Snap, Force Barrier, Phase Walk, med packs should be placed on quick and accurate keys. </li>
   <li> Kiting abilities (DoTs, Force in Balance, Force Speed, Slow etc.) should be bound to a key we can press on the move. </li>
   <li> Telekinetic Throw, Stun, Lift, Bubble, Force Mend, Rejuvenate are used a lot, and should have secondary priority (e.g. Shift modified). </li>
   <li> Benevolence, Force Empowerment, Meditate, Rescue, Revival, Vindicate these are rarely used and may be put on hard keys or no keys. </li>
   <li> The rest such as Mental Alacrity, Force Potency goes in between (e.g. Ctrl modified). </li>
   <li> Don't need to <i>hotkey</i> every ability, but class abilities and combat abilities (Heroic Effort, medkits etc.) should be on the bars. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Controls and keybindings are very personal. Experiment to find the one that suit you. </li>
   <li> I binds ESDF to move, (Shift/Ctrl)+AZXCVBGTR12345 to abilities, F1-F6 to DCDs, 6-0 to companion, `TabQW to targeting. </li>
   <li> I also assign easy keys to bubble and heals so that I don't need to shuffle them when I respec to Seer. </li>
   <li> You may or may not go to this extreme; only you can decide what works best for you. </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="about"> About Me and this Guide </h2>
<ul>
   <li> This guide is written in point form to stop me from going on and on. It is long enough in point form. </li>
   <li> I'm Elleé on the Satelle Shan server. </li>
   <li> I am F2P, and I play from Asian-Pacific. </li>
   <li> If you have teamed with a white haired lady in a white and green Elegant Dress on Harbinger/Satelle Shan, you may know me as a healer instead. </li>
   <li> Well we need a Balance PvE guide, and I learn to DPS better when I make this guide. </li>

</ul >

<h2 id="glossary"> Glossary </h2>
<dl>
   <dt> Adds </dt>
   <dd> Additional NPCs that arrive as reinforcement in the middle of a boss fight.  Usually should be taken down asap. </dd>

   <dt> AoE </dt>
   <dd> Area of Effect, abilities that act on the desginated area instead of specific target(s). Usually the more the target the merrier. Some AoEs are continuous and need the target to stay inside (e.g. Force Quake), but most are not. AoE are always circle or cone. </dd>

   <dt> Cast </dt>
   <dd> Casted abilities require us to stand still for a while to finish casting and take effect. They can be interrupted by crowd controls, and pressing Esc, moving, or using another ability also abort the casting. Damage we take during cast will pushback the cast bar, thus increasing total cast time. Force Serenity and Benevolence are casted. Alacrity shorten most cast times, and passive/utilities may allow a casted ability to be used while on the move. </dd>

   <dt> Channel </dt>
   <dd> Channelled abilities require us to stand still to use and deliver its effect in stages.  They can be interrupted by crowd controls, and pressing Esc, moving, or using another ability also ends them early.  Telekinetic Throw and Force Quake are channelled. Alacrity shorten most channel times, quickening their effects. </dd>

   <dt> Cleanse </dt>
   <dd> Healie's ability to remove up to two debuffs. Sages can clear Mental/Force debuffs and the other two can clear Physical/Tech. Healers can additionlly clear both Physical and Mental. </dd>

   <dt> Cooldown (CD) </dt>
   <dd> Most abilities has a coodown period of a few seconds to a few minutes during which it cannot be used again. Note that some abilities like Revival and med kits can only be used once per fight. Most cooldowns are non-fixed and can be reduced by Alacrity. </dd>

   <dt> DCD </dt>
   <dd> Defensive Cooldown. Powerful defensive abilities with a fixed cooldown. Sages' are Force Barrier, and Force Mend/Cloud Mind/Phase Walk with utilities. Rejuvenate and bubble can be always on, and are not normally considered DCD. </dd>

   <dt> Debuff </dt>
   <dd> Harmful effects applied to self, including as DoT, slow, damage vulnerability, and other bad status. Some debuffs can be removed by cleanse abilities, and almost all can be removed by purge. </dd>

   <dt> DoT </dt>
   <dd> Damage over Time. DoTs attacks "stick" on the target for their durations and deals damage at regular interval without requiring further actions. Each damage is called a "tick". </dd>

   <dt> DPS </dt>
   <dd> Has two meanings; in this guide, all caps "DPS" means characters in the damage role, and lowercase "dps" mean Damage Per Second, a key performance metric for these DPSs. High dps means high damage output. See http://ixparse.com/rating/ for endgame dps distribution in operations. </dd>

   <dt> DTPS </dt>
   <dd> Damage taken over Time. NPC damage is fixed, but when we use kiting to delay and scatter these damages, DTPS falls, giving us time to heal and our DoTs time to work. </dd>

   <dt> Endgame </dt>
   <dd> The part of the game that happens at close to max level, where gearing and skill improvement replaces rapid level and ability growth. Mainly PvP, master mode flashpoints/uprisings/chapters, a few high level planets, and operation in all modes. </dd>

   <dt> (E)HPS </dt>
   <dd> (Effective) Heal Per Second, a key performance metric for healers. High (e)hps means high healing. Overheal is counted into hps but not ehps. See http://ixparse.com/rating/ for endgame hps distribution in operations. </dd>

   <dt> Flashpoint (fp) </dt>
   <dd> Sometime called Dungeons, flashpoints are side-story team PvE activities for up to four players that take roughly half an hour to complete.  A quick way to level up, meet new friends, and get social points. Story mode is for solo, Veteran mode is for learning, and master mode is a challenge. </dd>

   <dt> Crowd Control (CC) </dt>
   <dd> Abilities that disable enemies such as stun, mez, sap, and push (over cliffs).  The literal definition, uncommon in the game, includes general pull, push, interrupts, LoS, and perhaps AoEs. </dd>

   <dt> GCD </dt>
   <dd> Global Cooldown. Most abilities put us on a short 1.5s cooldown during which we cannot use next ability. Alacrity can shorten GCD and thus increase action speed. </dd>

   <dt pattern="[Hh]eal(er| spec| can)"> Heal </dt>
   <dd> The act or role of healing, cleansing, and reviving teammates. Responsible for saving team from mistakes, critical in sustained fights. </dd>

   <dt> Healie </dt>
   <dd> Advanced classes that can spec into heal and have some healings even as DPS. The republic has Sage, Smuggler, and Commando. Of these, smuggler is melee but can heal at range. </dd>

   <dt> HoT </dt>
   <dd> Heal over Time. HoTs "stick" on the target for their durations and heals at regular interval without requiring further actions.  </dd>

   <dt> LoS </dt>
   <dd> Line of Sight.  The technique of hiding behind covers (tall boxes, pillars, doorways, wall corners) to block their attacks through line of sight, and lure them to group up at the corner. </dd>

   <dt> Mez </dt>
   <dd> Short of mesmerize. Commonly known as soft CC, a kind of Crowd Control that disables the target for a long duration or until they take <i>any</i> damage.  Some AoEs ignore mez and can be safely used, but ours are passive so we must take care when we AoE. </dd>

   <dt> Off-Heal </dt>
   <dd> Healie classes in DPS specs who can heal a bit. That means us. Off-heals lack lacks proper healing abilities and can only help a bit. </dd>

   <dt> Off-Tank </dt>
   <dd> Often used in an operation to refer to the non-main tank. Tanky classes are usually called off-tank too, but non-tank specs lack proper tanking abilities and can only help a bit. </dd>

   <dt> Operation (op) </dt>

   <dt> Passives </dt>
   <dd> Passive abilities that we get as we level up, such as Rejuvenate's defense bonus (lv. 12), Force in Balance's DoT spread (lv. 28), or faster Telekinetic Throw (lv. 56). </dd>

   <dt> Pin </dt>
   <dd> Immobilise effects - effects that prevents the victim from moving.  Unless it is a hindering effect, pins won't prevent escape by pull, jump, or teleportation. </dd>

   <dt> Proc </dt>
   <dd> Randomly triggered events, or the triggering of these events.  Commonly seen on relics, but every class has some proc passives.  Sometimes loosely used to describe all activated effects (random or not), such as saying Telekinetic Throw procs Vanquish. </dd>

   <dt> Purge </dt>
   <dd> An ability that removes all debuffs from self.  For Sages it is Force Barrier. </dd>

   <dt> PvE </dt>
   <dd> Player verse Environment. The part of the game where we compete with NPC enemies instead of real players.  Class missions, planet missions, heroics, flashpoints, uprisings, operations, and expasion chapters are all PvE. </dd>

   <dt> PvP </dt>
   <dd> Player verse Player. The part of the game where we compete with real players instead of NPC enemies. Duels, warzones, and open world PvP are all PvP. </dd>

   <dt> Rotation </dt>
   <dd> Rotations are ability sequences that lead to optimal synergies and outputs, such as dps or hps. Proc based discipline such as Telekinetic use a priority rotation.  Others such as Balance use a repetitive or segmented rotation. </dd>

   <dt> Sap </dt>
   <dd> A special form of mez that can only be used in stealth and on an organic target.  Usually used to bypass enemies without alerting them.  We have none since we can't stealth. </dd>

   <dt> Stun </dt>

   <!-- <dt> swtor </dt>
   <dd> Star Wars: The Old Re<span>pub</span>lic, somtimes simply Tor.  A Star Wars MMO game set thousands of years before the movies, when Jedi and Sith were more abundant and lightsabers less powerful. </dd> -->

   <dt> Tank </dt>
   <dd> The act or role of taking point and taunting enemies to draw their fire away from teammates. Tanks has many DCDs and usually stack defensive stats to endure the damage. The most heroic role in any team. </dd>

   <dt> Tanky </dt>
   <dd> Advanced classes that can spec into tank and have some taunts even as DPS. The republic has Guardian, Shadow, and Vanguard. All tankies are melee. </dd>

   <dt> Threat </dt>
   <dd> In PvE combat, every time we attack or heal we are threatening the NPCs, represented by creating a numeric threat. Each NPC keep a list of who is threatening it, a threat table, and will attack (aggro) the one who made the most threat. <br/> There is no threat in PvP; players decide who to attack. </dd>

   <dt> Tick </dt>
   <dd> Each stage of channelled abilities, DoTs, and HoTs is a tick. Force Quakes has 4 ticks, 3 of which deals damage. </dd>

   <dt> Trash Mobs </dt>
   <dd> Non-boss fight NPC enemies. Usually a small group of low difficulty NPCs standing there waiting to be defeated.
        In map design terms they make moving between boss fights less boring, and make the boss fight more dramatic in comparison. 
        Note that some (very rare) encounters have so much mobs that they are essentially boss fights, e.g. Landing Party Uprising's Zakuulan Ambush. </dd>

   <dt> Uprising </dt>
   <dd> No-dialogue team PvE activities for up to four players, like a short flashpoint.  No less deadly but drop a lot less rewards so few players run them. </dd>
