Usually should be taken down asap. </dd><dt> AoE </dt><dd> Area of Effect, abilities that act on the desginated area instead of specific target(s). Usually the more the target the merrier. Some AoEs are continuous and need the target to stay inside (e.g. Force Storm), but most are not. AoE are always circle or cone. </dd><dt> Cast </dt><dd> Casted abilities require us to stand still for a while to finish casting and take effect. They can be interrupted by crowd controls, and pressing Esc, moving, or using another ability also abort the casting. Damage we take during cast will pushback the cast bar, thus increasing total cast time. Force Leach and Dark Heal are casted. Alacrity shorten most cast times, and passive/utilities may allow a casted ability to be used while on the move. </dd><dt> Channel </dt><dd> Channelled abilities require us to stand still to use and deliver its effect in stages.  They can be interrupted by crowd controls, and pressing Esc, moving, or using another ability also ends them early.  Force Lightning and Force Storm are channelled. Alacrity shorten most channel times, quickening their effects. </dd><dt> Cleanse </dt><dd> Healie's ability to remove up to two debuffs. Sages can clear Mental/Force debuffs and the other two can clear Physical/Tech. Healers can additionlly clear both Physical and Mental. </dd><dt> Cooldown (CD) </dt><dd> Most abilities has a coodown period of a few seconds to a few minutes during which it cannot be used again. Note that some abilities like Reanimation and med kits can only be used once per fight. Most cooldowns are non-fixed and can be reduced by Alacrity. </dd><dt> DCD </dt><dd> Defensive Cooldown. Powerful defensive abilities with a fixed cooldown. Sages' are Force Barrier, and Unnatural Preservation/Cloud Mind/Phase Walk with utilities. Resurgense and bubble can be always on, and are not normally considered DCD. </dd><dt> Debuff </dt><dd> Harmful effects applied to self, including as DoT, slow, damage vulnerability, and other bad status. Some debuffs can be removed by cleanse abilities, and almost all can be removed by purge. </dd><dt> DoT </dt><dd> Damage over Time. DoTs attacks "stick" on the target for their durations and deals damage at regular interval without requiring further actions. Each damage is called a "tick". </dd><dt> DPS </dt><dd> Has two meanings; in this guide, all caps "DPS" means characters in the damage role, and lowercase "dps" mean Damage Per Second, a key performance metric for these DPSs. High dps means high damage output. See http://ixparse.com/rating/ for endgame dps distribution in operations. </dd><dt> DTPS </dt><dd> Damage taken over Time. NPC damage is fixed, but when we use kiting to delay and scatter these damages, DTPS falls, giving us time to heal and our DoTs time to work. </dd><dt> Endgame </dt><dd> The part of the game that happens at close to max level, where gearing and skill improvement replaces rapid level and ability growth. Mainly PvP, master mode flashpoints/uprisings/chapters, a few high level planets, and operation in all modes. </dd><dt> (E)HPS </dt><dd> (Effective) Heal Per Second, a key performance metric for healers. High (e)hps means high healing. Overheal is counted into hps but not ehps. See http://ixparse.com/rating/ for endgame hps distribution in operations. </dd><dt> Flashpoint (fp) </dt><dd> Sometime called Dungeons, flashpoints are side-story team PvE activities for up to four players that take roughly half an hour to complete.  A quick way to level up, meet new friends, and get social points. Story mode is for solo, Veteran mode is for learning, and master mode is a challenge. </dd><dt> Crowd Control (CC) </dt><dd> Abilities that disable enemies such as stun, mez, sap, and push (over cliffs).  The literal definition, uncommon in the game, includes general pull, push, interrupts, LoS, and perhaps AoEs. </dd><dt> GCD </dt><dd> Global Cooldown. Most abilities put us on a short 1.5s cooldown during which we cannot use next ability. Alacrity can shorten GCD and thus increase action speed. </dd><dt pattern="[Hh]eal(er| spec| can)"> Heal </dt><dd> The act or role of healing, cleansing, and reviving teammates. Responsible for saving team from mistakes, critical in sustained fights. </dd><dt> Healie </dt><dd> Advanced classes that can spec into heal and have some healings even as DPS. The republic has Sorcerer, Smuggler, and Commando. Of these, smuggler is melee but can heal at range. </dd><dt> HoT </dt><dd> Heal over Time. HoTs "stick" on the target for their durations and heals at regular interval without requiring further actions.  </dd><dt> LoS </dt><dd> Line of Sight.  The technique of hiding behind covers (tall boxes, pillars, doorways, wall corners) to block their attacks through line of sight, and lure them to group up at the corner. </dd><dt> Mez </dt><dd> Short of mesmerize. Commonly known as soft CC, a kind of Crowd Control that disables the target for a long duration or until they take <i>any</i> damage.  Some AoEs ignore mez and can be safely used, but ours are passive so we must take care when we AoE. </dd><dt> Off-Heal </dt><dd> Healie classes in DPS specs who can heal a bit. That means us. Off-heals lack lacks proper healing abilities and can only help a bit. </dd><dt> Off-Tank </dt><dd> Often used in an operation to refer to the non-main tank. Tanky classes are usually called off-tank too, but non-tank specs lack proper tanking abilities and can only help a bit. </dd><dt> Operation (op) </dt><dd> Also called Raid, operations are ultimate endgame PvE contents normally done in 8 or 16 person group, and require decent to very high skill and gear to complete. </dd><dt> Passives </dt><dd> Passive abilities that we get as we level up, such as Resurgense's defense bonus (lv. 12), Death Field's DoT spread (lv. 28), or faster Force Lightning (lv. 56). </dd><dt> Pin </dt><dd> Immobilise effects - effects that prevents the victim from moving.  Unless it is a hindering effect, pins won't prevent escape by pull, jump, or teleportation. </dd><dt> Proc </dt><dd> Randomly triggered events, or the triggering of these events.  Commonly seen on relics, but every class has some proc passives.  Sometimes loosely used to describe all activated effects (random or not), such as saying Force Lightning procs Demolish. </dd><dt> Purge </dt><dd> An ability that removes all debuffs from self.  For Sages it is Force Barrier. </dd><dt> PvE </dt><dd> Player verse Environment. The part of the game where we compete with NPC enemies instead of real players.  Class missions, planet missions, heroics, flashpoints, uprisings, operations, and expasion chapters are all PvE. </dd><dt> PvP </dt><dd> Player verse Player. The part of the game where we compete with real players instead of NPC enemies. Duels, warzones, and open world PvP are all PvP. </dd><dt> Rotation </dt><dd> Rotations are ability sequences that lead to optimal synergies and outputs, such as dps or hps. Proc based discipline such as Lightning use a priority rotation.  Others such as Madness use a repetitive or segmented rotation. </dd><dt> Sap </dt><dd> A special form of mez that can only be used in stealth and on an organic target.  Usually used to bypass enemies without alerting them.  We have none since we can't stealth. </dd><dt> Stun </dt><dd> Also known as Hard CC, a kind of Crowd Control that stops all actions of the target for a short duration.  e.g. Shock can stun weak and standard enemies. </dd><dt> swtor </dt><dd> Star Wars: The Old Re<span>pub</span>lic, somtimes simply Tor.  A Star Wars MMO game set thousands of years before the movies, when Sith and Sith were more abundant and lightsabers less powerful. </dd><dt> Tank </dt><dd> The act or role of taking point and taunting enemies to draw their fire away from teammates. Tanks has many DCDs and usually stack defensive stats to endure the damage. The most heroic role in any team. </dd><dt> Tanky </dt><dd> Advanced classes that can spec into tank and have some taunts even as DPS. The republic has Guardian, Shadow, and Vanguard. All tankies are melee. </dd><dt> Threat </dt><dd> In PvE combat, every time we attack or heal we are threatening the NPCs, represented by creating a numeric threat. Each NPC keep a list of who is threatening it, a threat table, and will attack (aggro) the one who made the most threat. <br/> There is no threat in PvP; players decide who to attack. </dd><dt> Tick </dt><dd> Each stage of channelled abilities, DoTs, and HoTs is a tick. Force Quakes has 4 ticks, 3 of which deals damage. </dd><dt> Trash Mobs </dt><dd> Non-boss fight NPC enemies. Usually a small group of low difficulty NPCs standing there waiting to be defeated.In map design terms they make moving between boss fights less boring, and make the boss fight more dramatic in comparison.Note that some (very rare) encounters have so much mobs that they are essentially boss fights, e.g. Landing Party Uprising's Zakuulan Ambush. </dd><dt> Uprising </dt><dd> No-dialogue team PvE activities for up to four players, like a short flashpoint.  No less deadly but drop a lot less rewards so few players run them. </dd></dl></details></article></body></html>
