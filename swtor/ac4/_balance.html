<blockquote class="pub"> There is serenity in balance, and no one knows this better than the Balance Sage.<br/>Able to assail multiple targets at once while at the same time absorbing their vitality,<br/>the Balance Sage is a formidable presence in long-range engagements. </blockquote>
<blockquote class="imp"> Delving ever deeper into the dark side of the Force can lead to madness, but it can also lead to immense power. Attacking multiple enemies simultaneously and instilling terror in their hearts, all while sapping their very life essence from afar, the Madness Sorcerer is a dark threat unlike any other. </blockquote>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Lighted robed, lightsaber wielding, seeks wisdom and allies over action. </li>
   <li class="pub"> Story highlights: Recover artifacts, visit kotor characters, form alliances and armies as a Jedi Master, join the Jedi Council, make a holocron. </li>
   <li class="imp"> Story highlights: Learn rituals, gather Sith ghosts, war a Darth and take his Dark Council seat. </li>
   <li> Spec: Ranged DoT, Jedi (Force-user), off-heal. </li>
   <li> Pros: Mobility, AoE, self heal, team support. </li>
   <li> Cons: Few defences, lack of burst. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="Quick Tips">
   <li> Stay in middle or back of group. Stay back and close to cover once combat starts. </li>
   <li> Trash fights: start with Sever Force and/or Weaken Mind, then spread them with Force in Balance. </li>
   <li> Use Force in Balance and Force Serenity on cooldown. Spam Telekinetic Throw so that we can use Vanquish on cooldown too. </li>
   <li> "Off-heal" with Bubble, but keep it minimal in combat. Use Restoration to self-cleanse. Use Revival in-combat if necessary. </li>
   <li> Maintain self bubble, and use Force Mend to self heal. Force Speed and flee when hp drops fast. Binds Force Barrier to a easy key for desperate time. </li>
   <li> Suggested <a href="#utilities">utilities</a>: Pain Bearer, Tectonic Master, Telekinetic Defense, Valiance, Egress, Mental Defense, Force Mobility, and your choice. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="Known bugs">
   <li> Resonant Pulse of Force in Balance hits only the triggering target, won't spraed out. </li>
   <li> Force Quake does not benefit from 10% Force cost reduction of level 15 passive. </li>
   <li> Phase Walk will disengage if we use it while hindered. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Excels at kiting and long fights, arguably the hardest Sage discipline. </li>
   <li> Stable rotation, zero proc dependency, very reliable relic proc. </li>
   <li> Self-heals grant great stamina in long fights, often the last one standing in a full wipe. </li>
   <li> Few defensives, either low mitigation and/or on long cooldown. Difficult to survive burst damage.</li>
   <li> Telekinetic is Sage's burst DPS spec, very mobile, crazy burst window. Perfect for leveling. </li>
   <li> Seer is Sage's heal spec, very versatile and efficient, the most mobile heal spec. </li>
   <li class="pub"> Balance has the most subtle animations of all classes and disciplines. If you prefer a low profile, there is no better class. </li>

   <li> Except when Force Quake is used after Force Potency, which turns all hits into autocrit. </li>
   <li> The rotation is 1 second shorter than cooldown because I have difficulty chaining Force Quake head to tail. Add a clipped Telekinetic Throw if your ping is better than mine. </li>

<h3 id="attacks"> Main Attacks </h3>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Dealing damage is our main job. </li>
   <li> Basic Attack: Telekinetic Throw (regen Force). </li>
   <li> Use on cooldown: Vanquish, Force in Balance, Force Serenity. </li>
   <li> Never hardcast Vanquish except to start a fight. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-1"> Telekinetic Throw </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 2: Deals <data value="9176">9k</data> kinetic damage and regain 12 Force over 2.1 sec. channel. During channel it immobilizes weak and standard target, otherwise slows target's movement by 50%. </li>
   <li> 2.1 sec. channel (four ticks), no cooldown, range 30m, regen 28 Force. </li>
   <li> Force-Master 4-pieces: Reduces Force cost of Telekinetic Throw ticks by 2. </li>
   <li> Level 24 passive: When Telekinetic Throw deals damage 4 times, your next Disturbance, Mind Crush, or Vanquish activates instantly, costs 50% less Force, and deals 25% more damage, for up to 15 sec. </li>
   <li> Level 40 passive: Each Telekinetic Throw damage has a 20% chance to triggers Rippling Force, dealing <data value="1197">1k</data> kinetic damage to the target and restore 2 Force. </li>
   <li> Level 64 passive: Telekinetic Throw hits increase your periodic damages by 2%, stack up to 4 times and last 10 sec. </li>
   <li> (Merged) Level 12 passive: Telekinetic Throw now has no cooldown. </li>
   <li> (Merged) Level 16 passive: Eliminate Telekinetic Throw pushback, and recover 2% Force (12) when it deals damage. </li>
   <li> (Merged) Level 56 passive: Telekinetic Throw ticks 33% faster (from 3s to 2.1s) but deals 25% less damage. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="key">
   <li> A no-cooldown, Force positive basic attack that we should use a lot. </li>
   <li> 4 hits (a full channel) make next Vanquish and Disturbance instant cast and do higher damage, and primed Vanquish is our main attack. </li>
   <li> Does require us to stand still and is the biggest hinderance to our mobility. </li>
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> When we can stay still and big powers are on CD; keep Vanquish primed! </li>
   <li> Slows a moving foe, whether it is chasing the tank or us. </li>
   <li> Finish off near death trash mobs and adds. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Ticks immediately and then twice per second, 4 ticks total. </li>
   <li> Hits does not need to be continuous for the buffs; can run, hit twice, run, hit twice. </li>
   <li> We don't get buffs if we fail to deal damage, such as because of accuracy or immunity. </li>
   <li> One Force Potency applies to all four ticks. A decent use of Force Potency on single target. </li>
   <li> Telekinetic Throw has high damage on paper, but Force in Balance and Force Serenity deals internal damage and are normally better Force Potency candidates. </li>
   <li> Originally cost 36 Force per channel, or 9 per tick. We recover 12 per hit, a net balance of 3 Force per tick. Natural Force regen also adds 16 over the channel, while set bonus adds 8. </li>
   <li> Rippling Force adds around 10% damage. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-29"> Vanquish (Mind Crush) </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Level 58: Casts and deals <data value="5258-5558">5k</data> kinetic damage, plus <data value="16654">16k</data> kinetic damage over 9 sec. and redistributes 10% of the damage to heal you. The target is Vulnerable for 45 seconds, taking 5% more damage from Force attacks. Replaces Mind Crush. </li>
   <li> Level 14 Mind Crush: Casts and deals XXX kinetic damage, plus XXX kinetic damage over 9 sec. and redistributes 10% of the damage to heal you. </li>
   <li> 2s casted, 15s cooldown, range 30m, 27 Force. </li>

   <li> Our biggest attack, fair upfront (burst) damage, heaviest and quickest tick. </li>
   <li> Always use after primed by Throw. 25% damage on our biggest attack. </li>
   <li> Make target vulnerable 5% to Force damage, which is virtually all our attacks. </li><!-- TODO is this applied first or after damage? -->
</ul>
<ol class="use">
   <li> Hardcast to start a combat. This is an exception to no hardcast rule. </li>
   <li> Use on cooldown. Telekinetic Throw often and reserve the buff for Vanquish. </li>
</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Ticks once per seconds for 9 seconds, 9 ticks total after upfront damage. </li>
   <li> Upfront damage is not DoT tick and does not enjoy DoT buffs. </li>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-27"> Sever Force </h4>

   <li> Ticks immediately and once per 3 seconds for 18 seconds, 7 ticks total. </li>
   <li> Deals internal (yellow) damage, which bypass many defences. </li>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-7"> Weaken Mind </h4>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-26"> Force in Balance </h4>
<ul class="desc">

   <li> Instant (0.2 sec delay), 15 sec. cooldown, range 30m, 45 Force. </li>
   <li> Level 20 passive: Force in Balance increase the damage the target takes from your next 15 periodic damage for up to 30 sec. </li>

   <li> Currently Resonant Pulse only hits the triggering target, instead of bounding to other enemies, in effect a flat 5% damage bonus. </li>

   <li> Force Wave's push distance is the lowest of all three. </li>
   <li> Cone goes towards character facing, not camera facing. </li>
   <li> Pushing enemies to a wall is a easy way to line them up, but will result in a wide line if standing too close when push. </li>

<h3> Heals and Defences </h3>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Not our main job. Most heals we do cost us action, which reduce our dps. </li>
   <li> Run behind cover and hide (LoS) is a damage control skill that we must get into habit of. </li>
   <li> Force Mend is our main self heal and is free. Force Serenity is our 2<sup>nd</sup> biggest attack <i>and</i> self heal. </li>
   <li> Life Ward has the potential to do lots of self heals in boss fights. </li>
   <li> Bubble is our most efficient "heal". Throw it out when a friend needs help. </li>
   <li> After combat, revive fallen mates and heal them. We can revive in combat, but let healer do that. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Since we are ranged, we can stand near kolto stations and use them. </li>
   <li> Since we are not healer, our heals generate full threat. </li>
   <li> Healing generate threat on every enemy, drawing their fire if no one else has threat, in which case Cloud Mind won't save us. </li>
   <li> Absorption is no longer bugged; multiple absorbs are spent on a first come first absorb rule. </li>
   <li> Don't forget we also have Heroic Moment, Unity/Sacrifice, Medpaks, and Shielding Adrenal. </li>
   <li> We can bubble and heal friendly NPCs, potentially trolling Imperial players in PvE instance. </li>

</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Can't stop instant death attacks and mechanics. Some forced movement mechanics ignore and would disrupt Force Barrier. </li>
   <li> Start with 1 stack and ticks at 2.1 sec., for a max of 4 stacks at 6.3 sec into channel. Tick speed is unaffected by Alacrity. </li>
   <li> Enduring Bastion seems to absorb 12k at 1 stack, 26k at 2 stacks, 39k at 3 stacks, and 60k at 4 stacks. </li>
   <li> Unlike Bubble which would absorb partial attack before collapsing, Enduring Bastion seems to always fully absorb the last attack (making it difficult to get accurate numbers). </li>

<ul class="note">
   <li> Bubble is not heal, and will not crit or be affected by healing bonus/penalties. </li>
   <li> When placed on teammate, absorbed damage is their threat, not our threat. </li>

</ol>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Tick once per 3 seconds, three ticks total after upfront heal. </li>
   <li> May be used on CD. Do ~30% more heals on cooldown than end-to-end. </li>
   <li> Upfront heal will consume Force Potency which is very wasteful. The HoT ticks do not. </li>

   <li> A full Telekinetic Throw grants us 28 Force (36 with 4-set bonus), while dealing damage and priming Vanquish/Disturbance. </li>
   <li> The debuff reduces our base Force regen rate before Alacrity multiplication; at 4 stacks it reduce our regen to zero and so Alacrity bonus also drops to zero. </li>
   <li> Vindicate's efficiency drops with each use because it refresh the regen debuff time, until 5<sup>th</sup> and up where the stack has hit its cap. </li>

   <li> In a team we usually need to use Cloud Mind on cooldown (if we are good), which means we can't afford to reserve it for DCD. </li>

<ul class="good">
   <li> <b class="good">Good</b>.
        Decent choice for when we don't know what to pick, since it guarantees some passive dps. </li>
   <li> Think an extra Disturbance every time it counter attacks, which is pretty good and almost guarenteed. </li>
   <li> Don't intentionally run into melee range or ignoring threat dump to attract fire just to get this to fire; DoT on a far enemy or AoE should catch enough attentions, don't give tank/healer headaches. </li>
   <li> Excellent for soloing low-power conflict where we are always under attack <i>and</i> bubble can take a few hits. </li>

   <li> <b class="good">Good/By Preference</b>.
        Give us a free and frequent passive crowd control, up to once every 20s. </li>
   <li> Blind is like stun. Blinded characters stops what they are doing and can't act while blinded. </li>
   <li> Not triggered when refreshing bubble before it pops, but triggered by manual removal of bubble buff (right click it). </li>
   <li> We must stay close to enemies to blind them, which runs counter to our usual stay back style. </li>

        Essentially gives us two interrupts and/or stuns. </li>
   <li> Also make our Force Lift usable on the go and immune from pushback, which is when we need Force Lift most. </li>
   <li> The stun not only put hard control on a soft control skill, but also gives a grace period to end-to-end Force Lift use, such as when disabling an add for a long time to delay next stage or wave. </li>

        Force Wave is not something we use often even when solo. </li>
   <li> Given the options we have at this point, there are few reasons to pick this. </li>
   <li> <i>Maybe</i> useful when we want to push and flee, such as just running pass, or group kiting. </li>

   <li> Legendary: Restoration activate instantly your next casted ability. Last up to 15 sec. and limited to once per 30 seconds. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="bad">
   <li> <b class="bad">Very situational</b>.
        Pick this to "prime" Force Serenity, Force Lift, or (if necessary) Vanquish before combat or behind cover. </li>
   <li> Wasteful because of extra GCD, even when it can <i>somewhat</i> replace Force Mobility and Containment. </li>
   <li> More useful as part of a team, where we let other go first and do our control and rotations later. </li>
   <li> Once upon a time all casted abilities light up when this triggers, making it easier to use. </li>
   <li> Do not pick just because we may cleanse. Most lower rank utilities are better options. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-20"> Life Ward </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Legendary: Force Armor, Force Barrier, and Enduring Bastion heal 1% hp every sec. This healing scales up to 4% with the charges for <a class="auto" href="#force_barrier" data-sprite="sage-15">Enduring Bastion</a>. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="good">
   <li> <b class="good">Good default</b>.
        Up to 1.2k "free" hps, or a Rejuvenate tick every second. </li>
   <li> Enduring Bastion is the 5 second shield left after Force Barrier ends. </li>
   <li> Most useful when there is no healer but plenty of meatbags to distract the enemy and preserve our bubble, such as veteran flashpoints. </li>
   <li> Bubble heals are usually wasted since healers can't resist their urges to top us up. </li>
   <li> Force Barrier heals us 28% hp, which is amazing. Bubble right before or right after it for more heal. </li>
   <li> A wonderful post-combat heal. </li>
   <li> Remember, actual heals generate a tiny threat to every NPC! </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-21"> Valorous Spirit </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Legendary: Reduces Force Mend cooldown by 5 sec. Force Mend increases damage reduction by 15% for 6 sec. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="vgood">
   <li> <b class="vgood">Recommended</b>.
        More Force Mend and free damage reduction when we need it? Yes please. </li>
   <li> I prefer Life Ward since it keeps us topped up, but this is a better panic button. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-22"> Ethereal Entity </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Legendary: Reduce Phase Walk cooldown by 15 sec. Phase Walk teleportation grants Ethereal Entity, increase defence by 30% and grant immunity to leaps, pulls, interrupts, and pushbacks for 10 sec. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="maybe">
   <li> <b class="maybe">Situational</b>.
        Turns Phase Walk into a DCD that we can use on par with Blockout Cloud Mind. </li>
   <li> Helps when kiting melee bosses who jump over as soon as (s)he gets LoS. </li>
   <li> Also useful when using Phase Walk a lot, like retrying jumps, so that we can spend less time on reddits. </li>
</ul>

<h4 data-sprite="sage-u-23"> Impeding Slash </h4>
<ul class="desc">
   <li> Legendary: Replace Saber Strike. Cooldown 15s. Lash the target with your lightsaber, dealing <data value="4920-5401">5k</data> weapon damage and immobilize it for 3 sec, then slow it by 50% for 6 sec. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="bad">
   <li> <b class="warn">Avoid</b>.
        The cooldown is longer than the pin and slow, and we must let the foe get close to use it. </li>
   <li> There are better utilities in<span class="pvp"> both</span> PvE<span class="pvp"> and PvP</span>. </li>
   <li> Even Force Wake is more useful and powerful when kiting. </li>

<h2 id="tips"> Leveling and Gearing </h2>

<h3 id="leveling"> Leveling </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Low levels: Use Force Quake and Force in Balance to dispatch minions, then Telekinetic Throw/Project remaining foe(s). Use Lift/Stun to pause tough NPCs. </li>
   <li> Mid levels: With instant Mind Crush at lv 24 and DoT spread at lv 28, we can meaningfully contribute in veteran flashpoints, a good way to learn and level up. </li>
   <li> Level 42+: With Force Serenity, we may use the Very Simple Rotation, but take away the final Telekinetic Throw. </li>
   <li> Level 56+: Telekinetic Throw now ticks fast so we can use the full rotation. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Free to play is limited to level 50.  Subscribe once to have access to current level cap forever.  Amazon and Origin sell cheaper packs than official site. </li>
   <li> When a new expansion lands, again just subscribe once to raise to new level cap. </li>
   <li> Many veterans stop playing much class story after getting starship (or even before that); Heroics and Flashpoints levels up quicker. </li>
   <li> Most world bosses do not require high level to hunt. If a group is forming on the planet you are on, join the fun! </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="gearing"> Gearing </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Typhon (Prologue): Don't buy any gear. Just do class quest and equip the best loots. </li>
   <li> Fleet: Go to left hand side of Supplies section and buy a set of moddable (orangw) gear. </li>
   <li> PvE stats: 110% accuracy, then Crit &gt; Mastery &gt; Power &gt; Endurance. Leave Alacrity until endgame. </li>
   <li> Modifications: Versatile hilt/armoring, Lethal Mod (unlettered), Initiative Enhancements. No augments until endgame. </li>
   <li> Upgrade main hand hilt, off hand armoring, chest armoring, and legs armoring at level X. They have biggest impact on attack and defence. </li>
   <li> Upgrade the rest whenever you like. I upgrade every two steps (8 to 10 levels). </li>
   <li> Optionally, run veteran flashpoints to get purple gears at current level, requires subscription or artifact authorisation. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Same relic effects don't stack; don't use two relic that proc the same stat.  I prefer proc relic over clicky relic; we have enough to click already. </li>
   <li> 110% accuracy is required to always hit NPCs, to ensures instant Vanquish from a complete Telekinetic Throw.<span class="pvp"> 105% in pvp for the same.</span> </li>
   <li> Not missing is also very important when you need that stun, mez, interrupt, or push to lands. </li>
   <li> Dump the rest into crit.  We don't have enough stat budget to get enough crit and make alacrity useful. </li>
   <li> Alacrity has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/7n6eu0/some_alacrity_numbers/">stepped impact</a> on GCD: 0% = 1.5s, 7.15% = 1.4s, 15.4% = 1.3s. Aim for these magic numbers, don't go below or between. </li>
   <li> Skip defensive stats (defence, shielding, absorption). We don't have the abilities to make good use of them. </li>
   <li> High endurance is not worth the mastery and power we lost. Always pick power and mastery over endurance, but after critical and alacrity. </li><!-- Plot a chart to find 5.7 falloff point -->
</ul>

<h3 id="gearing_endgame"> Endgame Gearing </h3>
<ul summary="Galactic Command">
   <li> Endgame armours has set bonus, which further boost our dps in addition to stat increase. </li>
   <li> At level 70, we earn cxp, instead of xp, to rank up Galactic Command, split into 4 tiers. </li>
   <li> Each rank up awards a command crate. Open them and they will "drop" endgame gears plus other stuffs. </li>
   <li> Each crate grants Command Tokens (CT), legacy wide and can be used to purchase Tier 1 (ir230) equipments on the fleet's Tier 1 equipment vendor. </li>
   <li> Disintegrate unwanted gear to get unassembled components (UC). PvP and GSF are the main UC sources. </li>
   <li> We can turn ir230, ir236, and ir242 gears into unassembled pieces by paying UC. i.e. Turns an ir230 helm to get Tier 2 unassembled helm. </li>
   <li> Keep these gears as an upgrade option, as drop rate of <i>useful</i> ir248 is very low. </li>
   <li> We also get unassembled pieces from operations. Take the pieces to Tier 2-4 vendor to turn them into gear. i.e. Tier 2 unassembled helm can be turned into any ir236 helm. </li>
   <li> When getting a gold armour/saber/focus that we already have, check whether its mod and enhancement can be used upgrade other gears. </li>
   <li> Focus's armouring can be placed on other armours, but that armour <i>will</i> lost its set bonus. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="Optimal Stats">
   <li> Power &amp; mastery proc relics (Serendipitous Assault &amp; Focused Retribution) are considered the best relics. </li>
   <li> Gold gears start dropping at Tier 2, and are good candidates to be augmented. </li>
   <li> 228 purple augments are the baseline augments. The material drops in Flashpoints and are in abundant supply. </li>
   <li> 230 purple augments drops in few places but is a pretty good step up from 228 because of additional Power. </li>
   <li> 236 gold augments is a little step up from 230 but requires rare materials that mainly drops from group ranked pvp. </li>
   <li> Aim for 110% accuracy, 40% crit, and 7.15% alacrity first. Optimal arrangement takes some effort to meet. </li>
   <li> 737 Accuracy gets us 110% (after companion bonus). 2x ir248 Initiative Enhancement/Implant/Earpiece and 3x ir228+ Accuracy Augments lands us at 750+. </li>
   <li> Alacrity should be just above 703 or 1860. 1x Quick Savant E/I/E + 5x Alacrity Augments gives us 711+, next best is same with Accuracy. </li>
   <li> 1860 Alacrity yields higher dps on dummy than 703, but not necessary in live combat. Use 6x E/I/E + 5x Augments to get 1866+. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> It is strongly advised to unlock all four class buffs and all five companion bonus first. </li>
   <li> If we learn Biochem and train it to 600, we can craft (or buy) and use reusable consumables. </li>
   <li> Opening command crates at top of tier 1 to 3 (close to but before rank 80, 190, and 299) will give better drop rate. </li>
   <li> At full 14x ir248 gear with 228 to 236 augments, we have 3654 to 3682 stat budget for Accuracy, Critical, and Alacrity, plus 214 Critical from Relics and Crystals, plus 339 with accuracy/critical stim. </li>
   <li> Accuracy/crit stim is a easy way to fill the stat budget, but I prefer mastery/power stim since I won't be dependent on it. </li>
   <li> Sever Force and Weaken Mind last a little bit longer than the <a href="#rotation">rotation</a> at all alacrity cutoff points, but the difference of clipping it, waiting it, or get higher alacrity for it is around 1%. I prefer to keep it simple. </li>
   <li> I haven't had time to test it, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/7upvqu/calculations_for_the_point_of_diminishing_returns/">some says</a> Critical's diminishing return is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/swtor/comments/7z945a/lightning_spec_gearing_alacrity_crit_and_power/duorlx6/">around 2250</a> for us. Exact point depends on mastery/power. </li>
   <li> Set bonus does not meaningfully affect practical rotation. They are more like passives that boost our dps when we keep our rotation going. </li>
   <li class="pvp"> PvP needs only 105% accuracy. Some players leave it at 101%. I don't play pvp well enough to comment either and I now don't gear for pvp. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="combat"> Combat </h2>

<h3 id="companion"> Companion </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Companion can be set to any role, which decides their abilities. When soloing, DPS role (same as us) make most combats fast and safe. </li>
   <li> Companion abilities can be excluded from auto-cast by right clicking the ability. The green box will go dark. </li>
   <li> When we disable non-attack abilities, they do more basic attacks and thus higher dps. </li>
   <li> DPS can stun, heal can cleanse, tank can pull; may disable these to increase dps and let us control when to use them and on whom. </li>
   <li> Use passive mode and Rescue to move companion out of AoE in boss fights. </li>
   <li> Use Heroic Effort to heal in hard fights, and Unity/Sacrifice if we have it. </li>
   <li> Fallen companions, self or of a teammate, can be revived in-combat like a PC. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> A companion with high influence rank fights pretty well. In heroics, flashpoints, and uprisings it is common to fill the team with high rank companions. </li>
   <li> Gift influence decrease as companion rank goes up. Dialogue and crew mission influence do not. It's preferable to fill first 15 to 20 levels with gifts first. </li>
   <li> Buy the companion gift bonus perks and lots of cheap $200 gifts ($250 for non-subs) from the fleet's trade section. Shift+Click to buy in batch. </li>
   <li> See <a href="https://torcommunity.com/guides/companions#influence-love">gift</a> <a href="http://dulfy.net/2015/10/21/swtor-fallen-empire-companion-influences-guide/#Companion_Gifts">guides</a> for which type to buy and how many. </li>
   <li> Get in and out of vehicle or rocket boost to fully recover companion hp out of combat. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tactic"> Tactics </h3>
<ul class="key">
   <li> Never go first; we are ranged not melee. Always let companion or teammate attack first. Exceptions: pure Sage group or companion dies too fast. </li>
   <li> Combat Priority: mechanics / survival &gt; adds &gt; teammate rescue / control &gt; spending our main attacks &gt; self-heal &gt; rotation fillers</li>
   <li> Bubble and Rejuvenate self before fight starts. Optionally place a Phase Walk. Keep bubble up during the fight. </li>
   <li> When under fire, run behind cover to force the enemies to run around it for easy AoE. This is called LoS. </li>
   <li> Stock up on med packs. Cheaper than dying. Use stim at (close to) max level. Use adrenal in tough fights. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="solo">
   <li> Start fight by lifting the furthest or strongest enemy. LoS the rest, spread DoT, Quake the weaks and normals, focus fire the rest one by one. Interrupt and stun champions. </li>
   <li> Spread <a href="#damage_over_time">Damage over Time</a> and <a href="kiting">Kite</a> the enemies. </li>
   <li> Force Wave can be used more or less liberally, but try to group the enemies for AoE. </li>
   <li> Buy and eat Peppered Bantha Steak and Chilled Corellian Cocktail to increase hp regen and companion effectiveness. Check the fleet's Cantina Vendor. </li>
   <li> When we finish a fight with Telekinetic Throw, use the primed Vanquish to start next fight before it expire! </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="team">
   <li> Move last or second last (around/before healer).  Find and stay near cover before and during combat. </li>
   <li> Thanks to our self-heal, sometimes it's beneficial for us to stand away from the group, not getting AoE heal but also less need to dodge AoE. Please stay close when there is no AoE, though. </li>
   <li> The more we lift, the more our teammates are aware that we'll lift. Lift as soon as combat start, so that tanks and other DoT DPS won't target them. </li>
   <li> Restrain on use of Force Wave and Rescue. They both change positioning, which is disruptive. </li>
   <li> DPS are generally not as important as tank or healer. Be understanding when we don't get resurrected. We help focus the heals on the survivors when we die! </li>
   <li> Use Cloud Mind often, even when we are not under attack, to keep our threat low. See its <a href="cloud_mind-notes">notes</a> for a story on that. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="respec">
   <li> Seer Sage is arguably the easiest heal spec to learn. </li>
   <li> It is recommended to learn it for flexibility in a team. </li>
   <li> Basics: Spam bubbles, cleanse debuffs, Rejuvenate to minor heal, Healing Trance to moderate heal, Rejuvenate + Roaming Mend to burst heal. Trance crits light up Vindicate, use to regain Force. </li>
   <li class="inline_icon"> Utilities: Always pick Force Mobility for mobile Healing Trance, our main heal.  Prefer survival options such as Egress and Mental Defense. </li>
   <li> For serious heal, healer's set bonus is pretty important.  We can wear 6 DPS set pieces and 1 healer piece, then we only need 5 healer gears to switch. </li>
   <li> Because of different ability names, respec on pub side and imp side will rearrange the abilities in a different way. </li>
</ul>


<h3 id="damage_over_time"> Damage over Time (DoT) </h3>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Our DoTs are heavy, often but not always our main damage output. </li>
   <li> Spread Weaken Mind and Sever Force to multiple foes to <i>multiply</i> our dps. </li>
   <li> Usually spread by Force in Balance, but put them on one by one when can't. </li>
   <li> After spreading DoT, use focus fire to take down enemy fast, i.e. Force in Balance and Force Serenity. </li>
   <li> When enemies are very weak or near death, just Quake, Throw, or Project. </li>
   <li> Enemies who hasn't been attacked by others will turn to us when we DoT them.  Be ready to LoS or endure their fire. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Spreadable DoTs deals ¼ to ⅕ dps of focus fire dps on <i>each</i> target. The more the targets the higher the total dps. </li>
   <li> Use LoS, push, or run into enemy pod to huddle up the enemies for easy spread. </li>
   <li> If you don't spread, don't play Balance; play Telekinetic instead. </li>
   <li> Our DoTs deals more damage on near death victims (hp &lt;= 30%), but should be placed early when they're healthier. </li>
   <li> Each damage is a "tick". Vanquish ticks faster, the others slower. </li>
   <li> High alacrity make DoTs ticks faster in a shorter duration, determined when placed. </li>
   <li> DoT ticks are indirect damage - no Force Potency but trigger and enjoy proc relic individually. </li>
   <li> Think our DoT feedback heals as relic proc chance instead of heals; they heal so little. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="kiting"> Kiting </h3>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Kiting is making opponent(s) run after us, always chasing but rarely or never catch us, like a kite. </li>
   <li> While they are chasing us, our DoTs and/or friends are hurting them. </li>
   <li> Very low dps; kiting is a slow war of attrition used when we would otherwise die too fast to see it through. </li>
   <li> Sage DPSs can't facetank and depends on kiting to survive hard fights. </li>
   <li> Run sideways when kiting, don't run forward or backward. This let us throws DoTs and other  attacks, but not run slow like backsteping. </li>
   <li> Keep the action up even when moving.  DoTs, Project, Force in Balance, Slow, Stun, Bubble, Rejuvenate. Revise utility to get even more. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Kiting is about damage control, about lowering dtps to a winnable level. </li>
   <li> If the foe is not immune, Force Stun, Force Lift, and Kinetic Collapse should be used with and preferred over kiting as damage control. </li>
   <li> Mainly for solo<span class="pvp"> and PvP</span>. In team PvE, let tankies go tank. </li>
   <li> Also applies when a boss is chasing us, because everyone else is down or mechanic reason. </li>
   <li> Kiting is not about not taking any damage.  We may take more damage than we deal.  As long as we can overcome the damage we take and our enemy can't, it is working. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="kite_common"> General Kitings </h4>
<ul summary="Melee Kiting">
   <li> Run in circle around a cover, throw AoE before our kite clears the corners, deal DoTs and instant attacks when it poke out, then flee behind cover and self heal. Rinse and repeat. </li>
   <li> Melee enemies often move faster than us and can jump to us, called a gap close. </li>
   <li> After being jumped, Force Speed to another cover to put some distance, and use the chance to Force Serenity or Telekinetic Throw. </li>
   <li> Use Force Slow, Confound, and other crowd controls if the foe is not immune. </li>
   <li> Ethereal Entity is our only way to be immune from gap close, and can buy us valuable time to pepper the enemy with casted and channeled attacks. </li>
   <li> Either set companion to heal so that (s)he doesn't draw the enemy away, or let him/her die and kite alone. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="Ranged Kiting">
   <li> Common form is same as kiting melee, except ranged foes don't have gap closer but often have AoE. </li>
   <li> Some ranged NPCs have casted attack; immediately run behind cover so that it fails, then poke out and attack. </li>
   <li> Some encounters do not give us any place to hide. In this case kite at 30m range - get in range, deal DoTs, then flee and let the foe chase us. </li>
   <li> The 30m kiting also works on melees without gap closers. </li>
   <li> Preferably we run in a big circle on the map. When we can't, Force Speed from one end of the map to another like a pendulum. </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="kite_special"> Special Kitings </h4>
<ul summary="LoS Kiting">
   <li> A special form of kiting when there is a big steam of trashes or adds that keep coming and coming. </li>
   <li> They always land at a fixed location.  Trigger the encounter, then run back far and behind a cover. </li>
   <li> The NPCs will come chase us.  This takes time, time for us to take the wave down, heal up, and cooldown for next wave. </li>
   <li> Use passive mode to stop companion from chasing them. Ranged companions preferred. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="Vertical Kiting">
   <li> A special form of kiting when the battleground has multi-levels, typically connected by stairs. </li>
   <li> Plant a Phase Walk at the level above or below from the enemies.  If there are multiples, put it closer to one stair than the other(s) to funnel the foes. </li>
   <li> Instead of a running fight like normal kiting, we can fight for as long as it is safe to do. </li>
   <li> When it's no longer safe, Phase Walk and patch up. The enemies will use the stair, giving us some quiet time. NPCs always move on solid ground; they never jump. </li>
   <li> If one trip is not enough, kite around the stairs until it cooldowns; most of these maps has multiple stairs that make it easy for us to kite in a vertical circle. </li>
   <li> If there is no stair and the enemies are below us, we can return to upper level but they can't follow us. Heal to full before dropping down again to finish them off. </li>
   <li> On some maps we can jump down to lower level instead of Phase Walk. The falling damage may make it less feasible, but falling has no cooldown. </li>
</ul>
<ul summary="Facetank Kiting">
   <li> Sometimes nothing else works.  For me this is KotFE Chapter VIII's platform fight with the Zakuul captain, on master mode, who jumps and empties my hp in two to three hits. </li>
   <li> We can stack our DCDs: Unity (50% 15s), Advanced Polybiotic Shielding Adrenal (30% 15s), Blockout (30% 6s), Ethereal Entity (30% ?s), Valorous Spirit (15% 6s), Rejuvenate (5% 9s). </li>
   <li> We must still kite. Apply DoTs, run, DCDs right before she catches us, facetank a few seconds, Phase Walk and self heal, refresh DoT when she comes again, finally Force Barrier. </li>
   <li> Note that Blockout may direct the enemy's attention to our companion, instead of serving as a DCD! </li>
   <li> Also useful: Heroic Moment, Life Ward, Swift Rejuvenation. Medkits and stims assumed. </li>
</ul>


<h3 id="interface"> Interface and keybinds </h3>

<p>
Some tips for setting up swtor interface for best Balance Sage experience.
</p>

<h4 id="gui"> Interface </h4>
<ul>
   <li> Go preferred or subscribe.  Preferred get four ability bars (sub six), enough for all class abilities plus a few more.
   You don't need to <i>hotkey</i> all abilities, but no class abilities are useless. </li>
   <li> Use team interface for non-op teams.  They show companion which may need our supports too. </li>
   <li> Enable "Highlight own effects" in target debuff bar, and scale it up.
   It let us see whether <i>our</i> DoTs and debuffs are on the target. </li>
   <li> Enable Focus Target and do the same. Use it to monitor our DoT on the boss and its casts/channels. </li>
   <li> Also enlarge own and friends' debuff icons, so that we can identify bubble/revive/raid-buff timer and cleansable debuffs. </li>
   <li> I sort all buffs and debuffs - own, friends, foes - by total duration, so that combat effects always go first and class buff always go last. </li>
   <li> Scale up target and focus target cast bars until you can easily see the action text. Target yourself and Medidate to see the bar in interface editor.</li>
   <li> Global scaling is independent from component scales, and should be set before fine tuning individual blocks. </li>
</ul >

<h4 id="keybind"> Keybindings </h4>

<ul class="key">
   <li> Move forward and strafe with keyboard, turn with mouse drag, attack with hotkeys, select target with mouse or hotkey. </li>
   <li> Life savers like Mind Snap, Force Barrier, Phase Walk, med packs should be placed on quick and accurate keys. </li>
   <li> Kiting abilities (DoTs, Force in Balance, Force Speed, Stun, Slow etc.) should be bound to a key we can press on the move. </li>
   <li> Telekinetic Throw, Bubble, Force Mend, Rejuvenate are used a lot, and should have secondary priority (e.g. Shift modified). </li>
   <li> Benevolence, Force Empowerment, Meditate, Rescue, Revival, Vindicate these are rarely used and may be put on hard keys or no keys. </li>
   <li> The rest such as Mental Alacrity, Force Potency goes in between (e.g. Ctrl modified or far away but not too difficult). </li>
   <li> Don't need to <i>hotkey</i> every ability, but class abilities and combat abilities (Heroic Effort, medkits etc.) should be on the bars. </li>
</ul>
<ul class="note">
   <li> Controls and keybindings are very personal. Experiment to find the scheme that suits you. </li>
   <li> I bind ESDF to move, (Shift/Ctrl)+AZXCVBGTR12345 to abilities, F1-F6 to DCDs, 6-0 to companion, `TabQW to targeting. </li>
   <li> I also assign easy keys to bubble and heals so that I don't need to shuffle them when I respec to Seer. </li>
   <li> You may or may not go to this extreme; only you can decide what works best for you. </li>
</ul>

   <li> This guide is written in point form to stop me from going on and on. It is long enough in point form. </li>
   <li> I'm Elleé (é=Alt-130) on the Satelle Shan server's Republic side. I am usually F2P, and I hail from Hong Kong, a vibrant and interesting ex-colony. </li>
   <li> I need Charged Matter Transubstantiator! Sponsor welcomed! </li>
   <li> If you ever teamed with a white haired lady in a white and green Elegant Dress on Harbinger/Satelle Shan, you may know me as a healer who literally spam bubbles. </li>
   <li> Well we need a Balance PvE guide, and I learn to DPS better when I make this guide. It takes time to test every ability rules I wrote in this guide, but I learned a lot. </li>
   <li> If this guide helps more players see what a bad place DPS Sage is at, and make EAware to buff Sage, well, it'd be 120% unintentional. &#x1f609; </li>
   <li> I may not be that qualified to write a guide, but I hope this is a good attempt. I think I tested every game rules written in this guide.

<h2 id="glossary"> Glossary </h2>
<dl>
   <dt data-regexp=""> Adds </dt>
   <dd> Additional NPCs that arrive as reinforcement in the middle of a boss fight.  Usually should be taken down asap. </dd>

   <dt> AoE </dt>
   <dd> Area of Effect, abilities that act on the desginated area instead of specific target(s). Usually the more the target the merrier. Some AoEs are continuous and need the target to stay inside (e.g. Force Quake), but most are not. AoE are always circle or cone. </dd>

   <dt> APM </dt>
   <dd> Action Per Minute, a key indicator of action efficiency. High APM means more actions were done, implying higher numbers. The "perfect" APM is 40 at 1.5s GCD, ~43 at 1.4s GCD, ~46 at 1.4 GCD, but lag typically reduces these numbers by 2. In real combat, time spent on movement, targeting, thinking, or simply waiting will reduce APM, while Off-GCD actions increase APM. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Aa]utocrits?"> Autocrits </dt>
   <dd> Most classes has abilities that automatically deal critical damage or heal on some conditions. These are called autocrits. Autocrits are almost always supercrits. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Cc]ast(?:ed)?"> Cast </dt>
   <dd> Casted abilities require us to stand still for a while to finish casting and take effect. They can be interrupted by crowd controls, and pressing Esc, moving, or using another ability also abort the casting. Damage we take during cast will pushback the cast bar, thus increasing total cast time. Force Serenity and Benevolence are casted. Alacrity shorten most cast times, and passive/utilities may allow a casted ability to be used while on the move. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Cc]hannel(?:ed)?"> Channel </dt>
   <dd> Channelled abilities require us to stand still to use and deliver its effect in stages.  They can be interrupted by crowd controls, and pressing Esc, moving, or using another ability also ends them early.  Telekinetic Throw and Force Quake are channelled. Alacrity shorten most channel times, quickening their effects. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Cc]hapters?"> Chapters </dt>
   <dd> Although the class stories and early expansions are split into chapters, endgame chapter specifically means KotFE/KotET chapters which can be replayed again and again in various difficulties. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Cc]leans(?:es?|ing)"> Cleanse </dt>
   <dd> Healie's ability to remove up to two debuffs. Sage can clear Mental/Force debuffs and Scoundrel/Commando can clear Physical/Tech. Healers can additionlly clear both Physical and Mental. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="(?:[Cc]ooldown|CD)"> Cooldown (CD) </dt>
   <dd> Most abilities has a coodown period of a few seconds to a few minutes during which it cannot be used again. Most cooldowns are non-fixed and can be reduced by Alacrity. </dd>

   <dt> DCD </dt>
   <dd> Defensive Cooldown. Powerful defensive abilities with a fixed cooldown. Sages' are Force Barrier, and Force Mend/Cloud Mind/Phase Walk with utilities. Rejuvenate and bubble can be always on, and are not normally considered DCD. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Dd]ebuffs?"> Debuff </dt>
   <dd> Harmful effects applied to self, including as DoT, slow, damage vulnerability, and other bad status. Some debuffs can be removed by cleanse abilities, and almost all can be removed by purge. </dd>

   <dt> DoT </dt>
   <dd> Damage over Time. DoTs attacks "stick" on the target for their durations and deals damage at regular interval without requiring further actions. Each damage is called a "tick". </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="(?:dps|[rm]?DPSs?)"> DPS </dt>
   <dd> Has two meanings; in this guide, all caps "DPS" means characters in the damage role (rDPS = ranged, mDPS = melee), and lowercase "dps" mean Damage Per Second, a key performance metric for these DPSs. High dps means high damage output. All classes can be DPS; StarParse collects operation <a href="http://ixparse.com/rating/">dps stats</a>. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="dtps"> DTPS </dt>
   <dd> Damage taken over Time. NPC attacks do fixed damage, but when we use kiting to delay and scatter these damages, DTPS falls, giving us time to heal and our DoTs time to work. </dd>

   <dt> Endgame </dt>
   <dd> The part of the game that happens at close to max level, where gearing and skill improvement replaces rapid level and ability growth. Mainly PvP, master mode flashpoints/uprisings/chapters, a few high level planets, and operation in all modes. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="e?hps"> (E)HPS </dt>
   <dd> (Effective) Heal Per Second, a key performance metric for healers. High (e)hps means high healing. Overheal is counted into hps but not ehps. StarParse collects operation <a href="http://ixparse.com/rating/">ehps stats</a>. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Ff]lashpoints?"> Flashpoints (fp) </dt>
   <dd> Sometime called Dungeons, flashpoints are side-story team PvE activities for up to four players that take roughly half an hour to complete.  A quick way to level up, meet new friends, and get social points. Story mode is for solo, Veteran mode is for learning, and master mode is a challenge. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Cc]rowd [Cc]ontrols?"> Crowd Control (CC) </dt>
   <dd> Abilities that disable enemies such as stun, mez, sap, and push (over cliffs).  The literal definition, uncommon in the game, includes general pull, push, interrupts, LoS, and perhaps AoEs. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="(?:off-)GCDs?"> GCD </dt>
   <dd> Global Cooldown. Most abilities put us on a short 1.5s cooldown during which we cannot use next ability. Alacrity can shorten GCD and thus increase action speed. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Hh]eal(?:er)?s?"> Heal </dt>
   <dd> The act or role of healing, cleansing, and reviving fallen teammates. Responsible for saving team from mistakes, critical in sustained fights. Effective heals generate threat on all NPCs, so DPSs and tanks must keep them off the healers. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Hh]ealies?"> Healie </dt>
   <dd> Advanced classes that can spec into heal and have some healings even as DPS. The republic has Sage, Smuggler, and Commando. Of these, smuggler is melee but can heal at range. </dd>

   <dt> HoT </dt>
   <dd> Heal over Time. HoTs "stick" on the target for their durations and heals at regular interval without requiring further actions. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="ir2\d\d"> Item Rating </dt>
   <dd> Every wearable gear has an "item rating", a numerical measurement of the item's power level. For example ir230 and beyond are classified as endgame gears. </dd>

   <dt> LoS </dt>
   <dd> Line of Sight.  The technique of hiding behind covers (tall boxes, pillars, doorways, wall corners) to block their attacks through line of sight, and lure them to group up at the corner. </dd>

   <dt> Mez </dt>
   <dd> Short of mesmerize. Commonly known as soft CC, a kind of Crowd Control that disables the target for a long duration or until they take <i>any</i> damage.  Some AoEs ignore mez and can be safely used, but ours are passive so we must take care when we AoE. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Oo]ff-[Hh]eal"> Off-Heal </dt>
   <dd> Healie classes in DPS specs who can heal a bit. That means us. Off-heals lack lacks proper healing abilities and can only help a bit. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Oo]ff-[Tt]ank"> Off-Tank </dt>
   <dd> Often used in an operation to refer to the non-main tank. Tanky classes are usually called off-tank too, but non-tank specs lack proper tanking abilities and can only help a bit. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Oo]perations?|[Rr]aids?"> Operations (op) </dt>
   <dd> Also called Raid, operations are ultimate endgame PvE contents normally done in 8 or 16 person group, and require decent to very high skill and gear to complete. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Pp]assives?"> Passives </dt>
   <dd> Passive abilities constantly enhances or upgrades our stats or abilities, and cannot be "activated" alone like active abilities. </dd>

   <dt> Pin </dt>
   <dd> Immobilise effects - effects that prevents the victim from moving.  Unless it is a hindering effect, pins won't prevent escape by pull, jump, or teleportation. </dd>

   <dt> Proc </dt>
   <dd> Randomly triggered events, or the triggering of these events.  Commonly seen on relics, but every class has some proc passives. Sometimes loosely used to describe all activated effects (random or not), such as saying Telekinetic Throw procs Vanquish. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Pp]urges?"> Purge </dt>
   <dd> An ability that removes all debuffs from self.  For Sages it is Force Barrier. </dd>

   <dt> PvE </dt>
   <dd> Player verse Environment. The part of the game where we compete with NPC enemies instead of real players.  Class missions, planet missions, heroics, flashpoints, uprisings, operations, and expasion chapters are all PvE. </dd>

   <dt> PvP </dt>
   <dd> Player verse Player. The part of the game where we compete with real players instead of NPC enemies. Duels, warzones, and open world PvP are all PvP. </dd>
   
   <dt> Pushback </dt>
   <dd> Ok, I'm part of a cross-gulid Chinese raid team, and we're looking for one more teammate in any role, preferably on both sides. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Rr]e-?[Ss]pec"> Re-Spec </dt>
   <dd> Switching to another spec, usually changing character role such as from DPS to heal or vice versa. Respec often implies rearranging abilities and switching gear, esp. when switching role. </dd>

   <dt> Rotation </dt>
   <dd> Rotations are ability sequences that lead to optimal synergies and outputs, such as dps or hps. Proc based discipline such as Telekinetic use a priority rotation.  Others such as Balance use a repetitive or segmented rotation. </dd>

   <dt> Sap </dt>
   <dd> A special form of mez that can only be used in stealth and on an organic target. Usually used to bypass enemies without alerting them.  We have none since we can't stealth. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Ss]pecs?"> Spec </dt>
   <dd> Called "Discipline" in swtor, spec is a fixed skill tree in one of the three roles. Each advanced class has three specs, and a character perk allows in-field respec which make it possible to switch role anytime. </dd>

   <dt> Stun </dt>
   <dd> Also known as Hard CC, a kind of Crowd Control that stops all actions of the target for a short duration. e.g. Project can stun weak and standard enemies. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Ss]upercrits?"> Supercrits </dt>
   <dd> When an attack's critical chance is above 100%, crit will 100% happen, and the remaining critical chance becomes bonus damage. For example if we have 40% crit rate and 70% crit damage, an autocrit at 140% crit rate will do 110% crit damage, i.e. doubling the normal damage. </dd>

   <!-- <dt> swtor </dt>
   <dd> Star Wars: The Old Re<span>pub</span>lic, somtimes simply Tor.  A Star Wars MMO game set thousands of years before the movies, when Jedi and Sith were more abundant and lightsabers less powerful. </dd> -->

   <dt> Tank </dt>

   <dt data-regexp="[Tt]ank(?:y|ies)"> Tanky </dt>
   <dd> Advanced classes that can spec into tank and have some taunts even as DPS. The republic has Guardian, Shadow, and Vanguard. All tankies are melee. </dd>

   <dt> Threat </dt>
   <dd> In PvE combat, every time we attack or heal we are threatening the NPCs, represented by creating a numeric threat. Each NPC keep a list of who is threatening it, a threat table, and will attack (aggro) the one who made the most threat. <br/> There is no threat in PvP; players decide who to attack. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Tt]icks?"> Tick </dt>
   <dd> Each stage of channelled abilities, DoTs, and HoTs is a tick. Force Quakes has 4 ticks, 3 of which deals damage. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Tt]rash(?: [Mm]obs?)"> Trash Mobs </dt>
   <dd> Non-boss fight NPC enemies. Usually a small group of low difficulty NPCs standing on the way waiting to be defeated.
        In map design terms they make moving between boss fights less boring, and make the boss fight more dramatic in comparison.
        Note that some (very rare) encounters have so much trashes that they are essentially boss fights, e.g. Landing Party uprising's Zakuulan Ambush. </dd>

   <dt data-regexp="[Uu]prisings?"> Uprisings </dt>
   <dd> No-dialogue team PvE activities for up to four players, like a short flashpoint.  No less deadly but drop a lot less rewards so few players run them. </dd>
